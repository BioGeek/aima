An implementation of algorithms from Russell and Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.

Original code on: 
http://code.google.com/p/aima-python/

This fork fixes some issues so that doctests.py runs without throwing errors. It also tries to fix the failures the code currently throws and tries to implement the missing algorithms.
