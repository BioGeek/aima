       cbs=BYTES
	      convert BYTES bytes at a time

       conv=KEYWORDS
	      convert the file as per the comma separated keyword
	      list

       count=BLOCKS
	      copy only BLOCKS input blocks

       ibs=BYTES
	      read BYTES bytes at a time

       if=FILE
	      read from FILE instead of stdin

       obs=BYTES
	      write BYTES bytes at a time

       of=FILE
	      write to FILE instead of stdout

       seek=BLOCKS
	      skip BLOCKS obs-sized blocks at start of output

       skip=BLOCKS
	      skip BLOCKS ibs-sized blocks at start of input

       --help display this help and exit

       --version

       BLOCKS  and  BYTES may be followed by the following multi-

       1024,  MD  1,000,000,  M	 1,048,576,  GD	 1,000,000,000, G
       1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Each  KEYWORD
       may be:

       ascii  from EBCDIC to ASCII

       ebcdic from ASCII to EBCDIC

       ibm    from ASCII to alternated EBCDIC

       block  pad  newline-terminated records with spaces to cbs-
	      size

       unblock
	      replace trailing spaces in  cbs-size  records  with
	      newline

       lcase  change upper case to lower case

       notrunc
	      do not truncate the output file

       ucase  change lower case to upper case

       swab   swap every pair of input bytes

       noerror
	      continue after read errors

       sync   pad  every  input block with NULs to ibs-size; when
	      used

	      with block or unblock, pad with spaces rather  than
	      NULs
