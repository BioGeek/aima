NAME
       jar - archive tool for Java archives

SYNOPSIS
       jar -ctxu [OPTIONS] [jar-file] [manifest-file] [-C dir] files...

DESCRIPTION
       "fastjar" is an implementation of Sun's jar utility that comes with the
       JDK, written entirely in C, and runs in a fraction of the time while
       being feature compatible.

       If any file is a directory then it is processed recursively.  The mani-
       fest file name and the archive file name needs to be specified in the
       same order the -m and -f flags are specified.

OPTIONS
       Exactly one of the following actions must be specified:

       -c  Create new archive.

       -t  List table of contents for archive.

       -x  Extract named (or all) files from archive.

       -u  Update existing archive. This option is disabled due to bugs (cur-
	   rently fails with exit status 1 and does nothing).

       The following parameters are optional:

       -@  Read the names of the files to add to the archive from stdin.  This
	   option is supported only in combination with -c or -u.  Non stan-
	   dard option added in the GCC version.

       -C directory
	   Change to the directory and include the following file.

       -E  Prevent fastjar from reading the content of a directory when speci-
	   fying one (and instead relying on the provided list of files to
	   populate the archive with regard to the directory entry). Non stan-
	   dard option added in the GCC version.

       -M  Do not create a manifest file for the entries.

       -0  Store only; use no ZIP compression.

       -V
       --version
	   Display version information.

       -f archive
	   Specify archive file name.

       -m manifest
	   Include manifest information from specified manifest file.

       -v  Generate verbose output on standard output.

       All remaining options are considered to be names of files.
