       -f, --fields=LIST

       -s, --only-delimited
	      do not print lines not containing delimiters

       range is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th	 (included)  byte,  character  or
	      field

       -M     from  first  to  M'th (included) byte, character or
