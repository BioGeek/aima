NAME
       passwd - update a user's authentication tokens(s)


SYNOPSIS
       passwd [-k] [-l] [-u [-f]] [-d] [-n mindays] [-x maxdays] [-w warndays]
       [-i inactivedays] [-S] [username]



DESCRIPTION
       Passwd is used to update a user's authentication token(s).

       Passwd is configured to work through the Linux-PAM  API.	  Essentially,
       it initializes itself as a "passwd" service with Linux-PAM and utilizes
       configured password modules to authenticate and then  update  a	user's
       password.


       A  simple  entry	 in  the Linux-PAM configuration file for this service
       would be:

	#
	# passwd service entry that does strength checking of
	# a proposed password before updating it.
	#
	passwd password requisite \
		    /usr/lib/security/pam_cracklib.so retry=3
	passwd password required \
		    /usr/lib/security/pam_unix.so use_authtok
	#


       Note, other module-types are not required for this application to func-
       tion correctly.


OPTIONS
       -k     The  option, -k, is used to indicate that the update should only
	      be for  expired  authentication  tokens  (passwords);  the  user
	      wishes to keep their non-expired tokens as before.


       -l     This  option  is	used  to  lock the specified account and it is
	      available to root only. The locking is  performed	 by  rendering
	      the  encrypted password into an invalid string (by prefixing the
	      encrypted string with an !).


       --stdin
	      This option is used to indicate that passwd should read the  new
	      password from standard input, which can be a pipe.


       -u     This  is	the  reverse  of  the  -l  option - it will unlock the
	      account password by removing the ! prefix. This option is avail-
	      able  to	root  only.  By default passwd will refuse to create a
	      passwordless account (it will not unlock	an  account  that  has
	      only  "!" as a password). The force option -f will override this
	      protection.


       -d     This is a quick way to disable a password	 for  an  account.  It
	      will set the named account passwordless. Available to root only.


       -n     This will set the minimum password lifetime,  in	days,  if  the
	      user's  account  supports password lifetimes.  Available to root
	      only.


       -x     This will set the maximum password lifetime,  in	days,  if  the
	      user's  account  supports password lifetimes.  Available to root
	      only.


       -w     This will set the number of days in advance the user will	 begin
	      receiving	 warnings that her password will expire, if the user's
	      account supports password lifetimes.  Available to root only.


       -i     This will set the number of  days	 which	will  pass  before  an
	      expired password for this account will be taken to mean that the
	      account is inactive  and	should	be  disabled,  if  the	user's
	      account supports password lifetimes.  Available to root only.


       -S     This  will  output  a  short information about the status of the
	      password for a given account. Available to root user only.


Remember the following two principles
       Protect your password.
	      Don't write down your password - memorize	 it.   In  particular,
	      don't write it down and leave it anywhere, and don't place it in
	      an unencrypted file!  Use unrelated passwords for	 systems  con-
	      trolled  by  different  organizations.  Don't give or share your
	      password, in particular to someone claiming to be from  computer
	      support  or  a  vendor.	Don't  let anyone watch you enter your
	      password.	 Don't enter your password to  a  computer  you	 don't
	      trust  or	 if  things  Use  the  password for a limited time and
	      change it periodically.


       Choose a hard-to-guess password.
	      passwd will try to prevent you from choosing a really bad	 pass-
	      word,  but  it  isn't  foolproof;	 create	 your password wisely.
	      Don't use something you'd find in a dictionary (in any  language
	      or  jargon).  Don't use a name (including that of a spouse, par-
	      ent, child, pet, fantasy character, famous person, and location)
	      or  any  variation  of your personal or account name.  Don't use
	      accessible information about you (such  as  your	phone  number,
	      license  plate,  or social security number) or your environment.
	      Don't use a birthday or a simple	pattern	 (such	as  backwards,
	      followed by a digit, or preceded by a digit. Instead, use a mix-
	      ture of upper and lower case letters, as well as digits or punc-
	      tuation.	When choosing a new password, make sure it's unrelated
	      to any previous password. Use long passwords (say	 8  characters
	      long).   You  might use a word pair with punctuation inserted, a
	      passphrase (an understandable sequence of words), or  the	 first
	      letter of each word in a passphrase.



       These  principles are partially enforced by the system, but only partly
       so.  Vigilence on your part will make the system much more secure.


EXIT CODE
       On successful completion of its task, passwd will  complete  with  exit
       code 0.	An exit code of 1 indicates an error occurred.	Textual errors
       are written to the standard error stream.


CONFORMING TO
       Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication modules for Linux).
       Note, if your distribution of Linux-PAM conforms to the Linux  Filesys-
       tem  Standard,  you  may	 find the modules in /lib/security/ instead of
       /usr/lib/security/, as indicated in the example.


FILES
       /etc/pam.d/passwd - the Linux-PAM configuration file


BUGS
       None known.
