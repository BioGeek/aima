NAME
     scp - secure copy (remote file copy program)

SYNOPSIS
     scp [-pqrvBC1246] [-F ssh_config] [-S program] [-P port] [-c cipher]
	 [-i identity_file] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [[user@]host1:]file1
	 [...] [[user@]host2:]file2

DESCRIPTION
     scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
     as ssh(1).	 Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if
     they are needed for authentication.

     Any file name may contain a host and user specification to indicate that
     the file is to be copied to/from that host.  Copies between two remote
     hosts are permitted.

     The options are as follows:

     -c cipher
	     Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This
	     option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -i identity_file
	     Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for RSA
	     authentication is read.  This option is directly passed to
	     ssh(1).

     -l limit
	     Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     -p	     Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
	     original file.

     -r	     Recursively copy entire directories.

     -v	     Verbose mode.  Causes scp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages
	     about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging connection,
	     authentication, and configuration problems.

     -B	     Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
	     passphrases).

     -q	     Disables the progress meter.

     -C	     Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to enable com-
	     pression.

     -F ssh_config
	     Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh.
	     This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     -P port
	     Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
	     this option is written with a capital 'P', because -p is already
	     reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file in
	     rcp(1).

     -S program
	     Name of program to use for the encrypted connection.  The program
	     must understand ssh(1) options.

     -o ssh_option
	     Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in
	     ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
	     there is no separate scp command-line flag.

     -1	     Forces scp to use protocol 1.

     -2	     Forces scp to use protocol 2.

     -4	     Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6	     Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.

DIAGNOSTICS
     scp exits with 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
