       pine - a Program for Internet News and Email

SYNTAX
       pine [ options ] [ address , address ]

       pinef [ options ] [ address , address ]

DESCRIPTION
       Pine  is	 a screen-oriented message-handling tool.  In its
       default configuration, Pine offers an  intentionally  lim-
       ited  set  of functions geared toward the novice user, but
       it also has a growing list of  optional	"power-user"  and
       personal-preference  features.  pinef is a variant of Pine
       that uses function keys rather than mnemonic single-letter
       commands.  Pine's basic feature set includes:

	      View,  Save,  Export, Delete, Print, Reply and For-
	      ward messages.

	      Compose messages in a  simple  editor  (Pico)  with
	      word-wrap	 and a spelling checker.  Messages may be
	      postponed for later completion.

	      Full-screen selection  and  management  of  message
	      folders.

	      Address  book to keep a list of long or frequently-
	      used addresses.  Personal distribution lists may be
	      defined.	 Addresses  may be taken into the address
	      book from incoming mail without retyping them.

	      New mail checking and notification occurs automati-
	      cally every 2.5 minutes and after certain commands,
	      e.g. refresh-screen (Ctrl-L).

	      On-line, context-sensitive help screens.

       Pine supports  MIME  (Multipurpose  Internet  Mail  Exten-
       sions),	an  Internet  Standard for representing multipart
       and multimedia data in email.  Pine  allows  you	 to  save
       MIME  objects to files, and in some cases, can also initi-
       ate the correct program for viewing the object.	 It  uses
       the  system's mailcap configuration file to determine what
       program can process a particular MIME object type.  Pine's
       message	composer  does not have integral multimedia capa-
       bility, but any type of data file --including multimedia--
       can  be	attached  to a text message and sent using MIME's
       encoding rules.	This allows any group of individuals with
       MIME-capable  mail  software  (e.g. Pine, PC-Pine, or many
       other programs) to exchange formatted  documents,  spread-
       sheets, image files, etc, via Internet email.

       Pine  uses  the c-client messaging API to access local and
       remote mail folders. This library provides  a  variety  of
       low-level  message-handling  functions,	including drivers
       for a variety of different mail file formats, as	 well  as
       routines	 to  access  remote  mail and news servers, using
       IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) and NNTP	 (Network
       News   Transport	 Protocol).   Outgoing	mail  is  usually
       handed-off to  the  Unix	 sendmail,  program  but  it  can
       optionally  be  posted  directly	 via  SMTP  (Simple  Mail
       Transfer Protocol).

OPTIONS
       The command line options/arguments are:

       address		   Send mail to address.  This will cause
			   Pine	 to  go directly into the message
			   composer.

       -attach file	   Send mail with the listed file  as  an
			   attachment.

       -attachlist file-list
			   Send mail with the listed file-list as
			   an attachments.

       -attach_and_delete file
			   Send mail with the listed file  as  an
			   attachment,	and remove the file after
			   the message is sent.

       -aux local_directory
			   PC-Pine only. When using a remote con-
			   figuration  (-p  <remote_config>) this
			   tells PC-Pine the local  directory  to
			   use	for storing auxiliary files, like
			   debug files, address books, and signa-
			   ture files.

       -bail		   Exit	 if  the  pinerc  file	does  not
			   exist. This might  be  useful  if  the
			   config  file	 is  accessed  using some
			   remote  filesystem  protocol.  If  the
			   remote  mount  is  missing  this  will
			   cause Pine to quit instead of creating
			   a new pinerc.

       -c context-number   context-number  is  the  number corre-
			   sponding to the  folder-collection  to
			   which  the  -f  command  line argument
			   should be applied.  By default the  -f
			   argument   is  applied  to  the  first
			   defined folder-collection.

       -conf		   Produce a  sample/fresh  copy  of  the
			   system-wide	   configuration    file,
			   pine.conf,  on  the	standard  output.
			   This	 is  distinct  from  the per-user
			   .pinerc file.

       -convert_sigs -p pinerc
			   Convert signature files  into  literal
			   signatures.

       -copy_abook <local_abook> <remote_abook>
			   Copy	 the local address book file to a
			   remote address book folder.

       -copy_pinerc <local_pinerc> <remote_pinerc>
			   Copy the local pinerc file to a remote
			   pinerc folder.

       -create_lu addrbook sort-order
			   Creates   auxiliarly	 index	(look-up)
			   file for addrbook and  sorts	 addrbook
			   in sort-order, which may be dont-sort,
			   nickname,   fullname,   nickname-with-
			   lists-last,	 or  fullname-with-lists-
			   last.  Useful when creating global  or
			   shared  address books.  After creating
			   the index file in this way,	the  file
			   should  be  moved  or  copied in a way
			   which  preserves  the  mtime	 of   the
			   address  book  file.	 The mtime of the
			   address book	 file  at  the	time  the
			   index  file was built is stored inside
			   the	index  file  and   a   comparison
			   between that stored value and the cur-
			   rent mtime of the address book file is
			   done	 when somebody runs pine.  If the
			   mtime has changed since the index file
			   was	made,  then  pine  will	 want  to
			   rebuild  the	 index	file.	In  other
			   words, don't build the index file with
			   this option and then copy the  address
			   book to its final destination in a way
			   which changes the file's mtime.

       -d debug-level	   Output diagnostic info at  debug-level
			   (0-9)  to the current .pine-debug[1-4]
			   file.  A value of  0	 turns	debugging
			   off	and  suppresses	 the  .pine-debug
			   file.

       -d key[=val]	   Fine tuned output of	 diagnostic  mes-
			   sages  where "flush" causes debug file
			   writing without buffering, "timestamp"
			   appends each message with a timestamp,
			   "imap=n" where n is between	0  and	4
			   representing	  none	to  verbose  IMAP
			   telemetry   reporting,    "numfiles=n"
			   where  n  is	 between  0 and 31 corre-
			   sponding to the number of debug  files
			   to  maintain,  and "verbose=n" where n
			   is  between	0  and	9  indicating  an
			   inverse  threshold for message output.

       -f folder	   Open folder (in first  defined  folder
			   collection,	 use   -c  n  to  specify
			   another collection) instead of  INBOX.

       -F file		   Open	 named	text  file  and view with
			   Pine's browser.

       -h		   Help: list valid command-line options.

       -i		   Start up in the FOLDER INDEX screen.

       -I keystrokes	   Initial   (comma  separated	list  of)
			   keystrokes which Pine  should  execute
			   on startup.

       -k		   Use	function  keys for commands. This
			   is the same	as  running  the  command
			   pinef.

       -n number	   Start  up  with current message-number
			   set to number.

       -o		   Open first folder read-only.

       -p config-file	   Use	config-file   as   the	 personal
			   configuration   file	 instead  of  the
			   default .pinerc.

       -P config-file	   Use config-file as  the  configuration
			   file	 instead  of  default system-wide
			   configuration file pine.conf.

       -pinerc file	   Output fresh pinerc	configuration  to
			   file, preserving the settings of vari-
			   ables that the  user	 has  made.   Use
			   file set to ``-'' to make output go to
			   standard out.  <IP>	-registry cmd  20
			   For	PC-Pine only, this option affects
			   the values of Pine's registry entries.
			   Possible   values  for  cmd	are  set,
			   clear,  and	dump.	Set  will  always
			   reset  Pine's registry entries accord-
			   ing to its  current	settings.   Clear
			   will	 clear the registry values.  Dump
			   will display	 the  values  of  current
			   registry settings.  Note that the dump
			   command is currently disabled.   With-
			   out the -registry option, PC-Pine will
			   write values into the registry only if
			   there currently aren't any values set.

       -r		   Use restricted/demo mode.   Pine  will
			   only send mail to itself and functions
			   like save and export are restricted.

       -sort order	   Sort the FOLDER INDEX display  in  one
			   of	the  following	orders:	 arrival,
			   date,  subject,  orderedsubj,  thread,
			   from, size, score, to, cc, or reverse.
			   Arrival order  is  the  default.   The
			   OrderedSubj	  choice    simulates	a
			   threaded  sort.   Any  sort	 may   be
			   reversed  by	 adding	 /reverse  to it.
			   Reverse  by	itself	is  the	 same  as
			   arrival/reverse.

       -supported	   Some	 options  may  or may not be sup-
			   ported depending on how Pine was  com-
			   piled.   This  is  a	 way to determine
			   which options  are  supported  in  the
			   particular copy of Pine you are using.

       -url url		   Open the given url.	 Cannot	 be  used
			   with -f, -F, or -attach options.

       -v		   Version: Print version information.

       -version		   Version: Print version information.

       -x config	   Use	configuration  exceptions in con-
			   fig.	 Exceptions are used to	 override
			   your	 default  pinerc  settings  for a
			   particular platform, can  be	 a  local
			   file or a remote folder.

       -z		   Enable  ^Z  and SIGTSTP so pine may be
			   suspended.

       -option=value	   Assign  value  to  the  config  option
			   option  e.g.	 -signature-file=sig1  or
			   -feature-list=signature-at-bottom
			   (Note:  feature-list	 values are addi-
			   tive)

CONFIGURATION
       There are several levels of Pine configuration.	 Configu-
       ration  values  at  a  given level over-ride corresponding
       values at lower levels.	In  order  of  increasing  prece-
       dence:

	o built-in defaults.
	o system-wide pine.conf file.
	o   personal  .pinerc  file  (may  be  set  via	 built-in
       Setup/Config menu.)
	o command-line options.
	o system-wide pine.conf.fixed file.

       There is one exception to the rule that configuration val-
       ues  are	 replaced  by  the  value of the same option in a
       higher-precedence file: the feature-list variable has val-
       ues  that  are  additive, but can be negated by prepending
       "no-" in front of an individual feature	name.  Unix  Pine
       also uses the following environment variables:

	 TERM
	 DISPLAY       (determines  if	Pine  can  display  IMAGE
       attachments.)
	 SHELL	     (if not set, default is /bin/sh )
	 MAILCAPS    (semicolon delimited list of path	names  to
       mailcap files)
