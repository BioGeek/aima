       -p] [ -r ] [ -C/J/T title ] [ file(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpr submits files for printing. Files named on  the  command  line  are
       sent to the named printer (or the system default destination if no des-
       tination is specified). If no files are listed on the command-line  lpr
       reads the print file from the standard input.

       -l
	    Specifies  that the print file is already formatted for the desti-

	    alent to "-oraw".

       -p
