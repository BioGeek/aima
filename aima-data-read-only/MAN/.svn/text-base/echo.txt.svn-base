NAME
       echo - display a line of text

SYNOPSIS
       echo [OPTION]... [STRING]...

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:  your shell may have its own version of echo which will supercede
       the version described here. Please refer to your shell's	 documentation
       for details about the options it supports.

       Echo the STRING(s) to standard output.

       -n     do not output the trailing newline

       -e     enable interpretation of the backslash-escaped characters listed
	      below

       -E     disable interpretation of those sequences in STRINGs

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       Without -E, the following sequences are recognized and interpolated:

       \NNN   the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal)

       \\     backslash

       \a     alert (BEL)

       \b     backspace

       \c     suppress trailing newline

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     carriage return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab
