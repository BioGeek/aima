NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... --target-directory=DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       -a, --archive
	      same as -dpR

       --backup[=CONTROL]
	      make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -d, --no-dereference
	      never follow symbolic links

       -f, --force
	      if  an  existing destination file cannot be opened,
	      remove it and try again

       -i, --interactive
	      prompt before overwrite

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links

       -l, --link
	      link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
	      always follow symbolic links

       -p, --preserve
	      preserve file attributes if possible

       --parents
	      append source path to DIRECTORY

       -P     same as `--parents' for  now;  soon  to  change  to
	      `--no-dereference' to conform to POSIX

       -r     copy recursively, non-directories as files WARNING:
	      use -R instead when you might  copy  special  files
	      like FIFOs or /dev/zero

       --remove-destination
	      remove   each   existing	destination  file  before
	      attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
	      control creation of sparse files

       -R, --recursive
	      copy directories recursively

       --strip-trailing-slashes remove any trailing slashes  from
       each SOURCE
	      argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
	      make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
	      override the usual backup suffix

       --target-directory=DIRECTORY
	      move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -u, --update
	      copy only when the SOURCE file is	 newer	than  the
	      destination  file	 or  when the destination file is
	      missing

       -v, --verbose
	      explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
	      stay on this file system

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected  by	 a  crude
       heuristic  and  the corresponding DEST file is made sparse
       as well.	 That is the behavior selected by  --sparse=auto.
       Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file when-
       ever the SOURCE file contains a long  enough  sequence  of
       zero  bytes.   Use  --sparse=never  to inhibit creation of
       sparse files.

       The backup suffix is `~', unless set with --suffix or SIM-
       PLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.   The	 version  control  method  may be
       selected via the	 --backup  option  or  through	the  VER-
       SION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
	      never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
	      make numbered backups

       existing, nil
	      numbered	if  numbered backups exist, simple other-
	      wise

       simple, never
	      always make simple backups

       As a special case, cp makes a backup of	SOURCE	when  the
       force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are
       the same name for an existing, regular file.
