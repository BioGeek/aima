NAME
       ln - make links between files

SYNOPSIS
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET [LINK_NAME]
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY
       ln [OPTION]... --target-directory=DIRECTORY TARGET...

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a  link	to  the	 specified  TARGET  with optional
       LINK_NAME.  If LINK_NAME is omitted, a link with the  same
       basename	 as  the  TARGET is created in the current direc-
       tory.  When using the second form with more than one  TAR-
       GET,  the last argument must be a directory;  create links
       in  DIRECTORY  to  each	TARGET.	  Create  hard	links  by
       default,	 symbolic  links  with --symbolic.  When creating
       hard links, each TARGET must exist.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
	      make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -d, -F, --directory
	      hard link directories (super-user only)

       -f, --force
	      remove existing destination files

       -n, --no-dereference
	      treat destination that is a symlink to a	directory
	      as if it were a normal file

       -i, --interactive
	      prompt whether to remove destinations

       -s, --symbolic
	      make symbolic links instead of hard links

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
	      override the usual backup suffix

       --target-directory=DIRECTORY
	      specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links

       -v, --verbose
	      print name of each file before linking

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       The backup suffix is `~', unless set with --suffix or SIM-
       PLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The	version	 control  method  may  be
       selected	 via  the  --backup  option  or	 through the VER-
       SION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
	      never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
	      make numbered backups

       existing, nil
	      numbered if numbered backups exist,  simple  other-
	      wise

       simple, never
	      always make simple backups
