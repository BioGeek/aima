NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the  GNU version of rm.  rm
       removes each specified file.   By  default,  it	does  not
       remove directories.

       If  a file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty, and
       the -f or --force option is not given, rm prompts the user
       for  whether to remove the file.	 If the response does not
       begin with `y' or `Y', the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -d, --directory
	      unlink directory,	 even  if  non-empty  (super-user
	      only)

       -f, --force
	      ignore nonexistent files, never prompt

       -i, --interactive
	      prompt before any removal

       -r, -R, --recursive
	      remove the contents of directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
	      explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       To remove a file whose name starts with a `-', for example
       `-foo', use one of these commands:

	      ../src/rm -- -foo

	      ../src/rm ./-foo

       Note that if you use rm to remove a file,  it  is  usually
       possible	 to  recover  the  contents of that file.  If you
       want more assurance that the contents are truly unrecover-
       able, consider using shred.
