NAME
       sort - sort lines of text files

SYNOPSIS
       sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard out-
       put.

       Ordering options:

       Mandatory arguments to  long  options  are  mandatory  for
       short options too.

       -b, --ignore-leading-blanks ignore leading blanks

       -d, --dictionary-order
	      consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters

       -f, --ignore-case
	      fold lower case to upper case characters

       -g, --general-numeric-sort
	      compare according to general numerical value

       -i, --ignore-nonprinting
	      consider only printable characters

       -M, --month-sort
	      compare (unknown) < `JAN' < ... < `DEC'

       -n, --numeric-sort
	      compare according to string numerical value

       -r, --reverse
	      reverse the result of comparisons

       Other options:

       -c, --check
	      check whether input is sorted; do not sort

       -k, --key=POS1[,POS2]
	      start a key at POS1, end it at POS 2 (origin 1)

       -m, --merge
	      merge already sorted files; do not sort

       -o, --output=FILE
	      write result to FILE instead of standard output

       -s, --stable
	      stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison

       -S, --buffer-size=SIZE
	      use SIZE for main memory buffer

       -t,  --field-separator=SEP  use	SEP  instead  of  non- to
	      whitespace transition

       -T, --temporary-directory=DIR
	      use DIR for temporaries, not $TMPDIR or /tmp multi-
	      ple options specify multiple directories

       -u, --unique
	      with  -c: check for strict ordering otherwise: out-
	      put only the first of an equal run

       -z, --zero-terminated
	      end lines with 0 byte, not newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       POS is F[.C][OPTS], where F is the field number and C  the
       character position in the field.	 OPTS is one or more sin-
       gle-letter ordering options, which override global  order-
       ing  options  for  that	key.  If no key is given, use the
       entire line as the key.

       SIZE may be followed by the following multiplicative  suf-
       fixes:  %  1%  of memory, b 1, K 1024 (default), and so on
       for M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       *** WARNING *** The locale specified  by	 the  environment
       affects	sort  order.  Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional
       sort order that uses native byte values.
