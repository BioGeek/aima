KILL(1)			   Linux Programmer's Manual		       KILL(1)



NAME
       kill - terminate a process

SYNOPSIS
       kill [ -s signal | -p ] [ -a ] [ -- ] pid ...
       kill -l [ signal ]

DESCRIPTION
       The command kill sends the specified signal to the specified process or
       process group.  If no signal is specified, the  TERM  signal  is	 sent.
       The  TERM  signal  will	kill processes which do not catch this signal.
       For other processes, it may be necessary to use the  KILL  (9)  signal,
       since this signal cannot be caught.

       Most  modern  shells  have a builtin kill function, with a usage rather
       similar to that of the  command	described  here.  The  `-a'  and  `-p'
       options, and the possibility to specify pids by command name is a local
       extension.

OPTIONS
       pid... Specify the list of processes that kill should signal.  Each pid
	      can be one of five things:


	      n	     where n is larger than 0.	The process with pid n will be
		     signaled.

	      0	     All processes in the current process group are  signaled.

	      -1     All processes with pid larger than 1 will be signaled.

	      -n     where n is larger than 1.	All processes in process group
		     n are signaled.  When an argument of  the	form  `-n'  is
		     given,  and it is meant to denote a process group, either
		     the signal must be specified first, or the argument  must
		     be	 preceded by a `--' option, otherwise it will be taken
		     as the signal to send.

	      commandname
		     All processes invoked using that name will be signaled.

       -s signal
	      Specify the signal to send.  The signal may be given as a signal
	      name or number.

       -l     Print   a	  list	 of   signal   names.	 These	are  found  in
	      /usr/include/linux/signal.h

       -a     Do not restrict the commandname-to-pid conversion	 to  processes
	      with the same uid as the present process.

       -p     Specify  that kill should only print the process id (pid) of the
	      named processes, and not send any signals.

       ids was added by Salvatore Valente <svalente@mit.edu>.
