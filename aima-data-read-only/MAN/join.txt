NAME
       join - join lines of two files on a common field

SYNOPSIS
       join [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

DESCRIPTION
       For  each  pair of input lines with identical join fields, write a line
       to standard output.  The default join field is the first, delimited  by
       whitespace.   When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.

       -a SIDE
	      print unpairable lines coming from file SIDE

       -e EMPTY
	      replace missing input fields with EMPTY

       -i, --ignore-case ignore differences in case when comparing fields

       -j FIELD
	      (obsolescent) equivalent to `-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'

       -j1 FIELD
	      (obsolescent) equivalent to `-1 FIELD'

       -j2 FIELD
	      (obsolescent) equivalent to `-2 FIELD'

       -o FORMAT
	      obey FORMAT while constructing output line

       -t CHAR
	      use CHAR as input and output field separator

       -v SIDE
	      like -a SIDE, but suppress joined output lines

       -1 FIELD
	      join on this FIELD of file 1

       -2 FIELD
	      join on this FIELD of file 2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

       Unless -t CHAR  is  given,  leading  blanks  separate  fields  and  are
       ignored,	 else fields are separated by CHAR.  Any FIELD is a field num-
       ber counted from 1.  FORMAT is one or more  comma  or  blank  separated
       specifications, each being `SIDE.FIELD' or `0'.	Default FORMAT outputs
       the join field, the remaining fields from FILE1, the  remaining	fields
       from FILE2, all separated by CHAR.
