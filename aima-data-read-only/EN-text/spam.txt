Oh, yes.  Please, I would be thrilled to accept
10 million dollars.  Please send me your credit
card and bank numbers, and I will reserve you a
first-class airline ticket to visit Europe and
meet you there.  I can be at the Schipohl airport
in Amsterdam next Tuesday.  Please send me your
MasterCard charge account, and your bank checking
account and routing number.

So sorry to hear about your father.  He was
a great man, and is sorely missed.  

I appreciate your willingness to donate to
my foundation.  The children of the world who are 
starving for intellectual stimulation will praise
your name!

I am MOSHOOD Mobutu Sese Seko, son of the late
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Congo Democratic Republic former 
Republic of Zaire presently there is a war going on in

my country and so my family members escaped to Morroco

while I am presently at Cotonou/Nigeria Border

environment is not conductive for investment and more 
over, most of my fathers properties and account have 
been frozen by the present government of Laurent 
Kabila. 
 
Now, I want to set up a business overseas and I have 
about $50 Million united state dollars set aside for 
this project, I decided to contact you to help me in 
setting up a business, but would not want my name or 
family name to be used. 
 
I am prepared to give you 20% of the total sum if you 
can assist me in claiming this fund from a security 
volt in Europe where my father (Mobutu Sese Seko) 
deposited this fund before he died. 
 
Please, do contact me immediately for us to discuss. 
As soon as I hear from you, and confirm your 
assistance every documents regarding to the claiming 
of this fund will be handed over to you as the 
familys foreign partner.

My name is Danjuma Sule, one of the sons of major Gen Gumel Danjuma Sule,
The late Nigeria's former minister of mines and power in the regime of the
late former Nigeria's military Head of state, Gen
Sanni Abacha. 

He married my mother on the agreement that my mother,Amina Fausat Sule,
will maintain her family's name together with her children. Before he died
in the German hospital on the 15th of November 1988 where he went to
operate on the cancer of the knee, he fixed the Sum of $30,000.000.00 in
the Central Bank of Nigeria under Intartrade Ventures Ltd on behalf of my
mother. The 3 yrs maturity period placed on the money is due but the
problem we are having now is that we lost the whole of the documents as a
result of fire, which gutted our house
3 months ago. 

We have discussed with our family attorney on how to collect the money
with out hitches, he advised us to liaise with a foreigner who will act as
the foreign partner of Intartrade Ventures Ltd and will purport that The
money in question is urgently needed overseas for an important project. 

It is on this basis I am seeking for assistance. Your percentage is
negotiable. Please note; your age and profession doesn't really matter in
this transaction. Waiting for your immediate response.

Regards, 
Danjuma Sule

ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Tell:(225)07 62 53 48
         
 Sir,             BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

I do recognize the surprise this urgent letter will
bring to you especially
as it came from a stranger.  First, I must introduce
myself.  I am DR IDAMACO HASSAN from the Diamond-Rich
district of Kono, Sierra Leone, and my
father was the former Special Adviser to the ousted
Head of State of Sierra
Leone, Major Johnny Paul Koroma.  I got your Email
address and other details
from the International Chamber of Commerce here in
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire

During the war between our forces led by the Ex-Head
of State, Major Johnny
Koroma and the West African Allied Forces (ECOMOG), my
country relied
heavily on the foreign earnings generated from diamond
trade.  This money
was personally kept by the then President, Major
Johnny Paul Koroma since
our banking system had collapsed during the war.

However, as the war progressed, it became apparent
that we were going to
loose the war to the superior and better armed West
African Allied Forces
(ECOMOG).  At this point, the key officers of the
administration started
making frantic efforts on how to leave Sierra Leone
safely thereby sharing
the proceeds/money from this diamond trade.  In view
of the fact that my
father was one of the key officers of the then
administration and an In-law
to Major Paul Koroma, he succeeded in getting the sum
of US$18 Million
(Eighteen Million United States Dollars).

We made arrangement and transferred the money through
diplomatic means to
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire, where I am presently living in
exile as an asylum seeker but
unfortunately, my father died of heart attack after a
few months of exile in
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire and automatically, I came in
total control of the said money as
the only surviving son.  Upon our arrival in Abidjan
Cote D'Ivoire after due
consideration, we deposited the money with a security
company for security
reasons.  The actual content was not disclosed to them
(security company)
pending when we see a trustworthy person such as
yourself who will assist us
in transferring this money to his account outside
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire, as the
strict Monetary Laws here do not allow asylum seekers
certain financial
rights.

I shall be most grateful if you can assist me
accomplish this transaction
and hoping too that you will remain trustworthy.  For
your efforts and
assistance, I have agreed to give you 20% of the total
sum while 5% will be
set aside for all the expenses incurred in the course
of this transaction.
The rest of the 75% will be for my family investment
in your country.

Please, note that I have made arrangements for
successful deal.  As such,
the only thing I ask from you is total assistance to
transfer this money,
complete trust and assurance that my own part of the
money will be safe when
transferred to your account.  I would also wish you
kept this proposal
highly confidential and secret considering my father's
position before his
death and the source of the money.  If you are
interested in assisting me,
please Call or send me an Email address as soon as
possible with the Email
address above.  Thanking you in advance for your
anticipated cooperation.

Best regards,


DR IDAMACO HASSAN

DEAR Sir
 I foresee the suprise this letter will bring to you
as it come from someone with no previous contact or
business relationship.Please consider this as a
despirate plea from someone in dire need of help and
with the best of intention for both of us. Your adress
got to me coutesy of a business jurnal at the worid
trade center in Johanesburg South Africa and after due
considration from your profile,Iam assured of your
crediblity and trust hence i decided to contact you.

 I am darba Gambo from the Republic of Sierre Leone,my
father served as the defence chief\adviser to the
ousted Head of state ,Major Poul Koromah till 1998 .He
was incharge of procurement of Arms and Ammunitions. 

But as the war progresses,it became apparant that we
will loose to the Goverment troops who were heavily
armed and barked by the West African Allied
Forces(ECOMOG) he quickly made an arrangment to
safeguard the future and life of his family and to
establish himself in a meaningful business outside my
country . He used his position to over-inflate the
cost of arms and amination purchased to the tune of
US$25M(twenty five million dollars) when the money
disbursed, he recieved the (USD$25 million )which he
locked in the family safe.

Two months later he resigned from the millitry
services and escaped with his family and the money
stashed in a safe deposite box to South Africa. We
were granted temporary political assylum with
restricted finicial right,so he could not open a bank
account or a business enterprise. However, he
succeeded in depositing the money in a private
Security Company for safekeeping and declared the box
as containing land documents and precious stones .
Later my father died and was buired in South
Africa,and iam here with my sick mother and my younger
brother .

 My aim of contacting you is to help me in transfaring
this money into your nominated account,and to help me
engage in a profitable business investment in your
country.I will offer you 25% commission if the total
fund for your assistance and services,and will also
offset any expenses you incur in the business when we
conclude with 5%.

 This business needs utmost trust and confidentiality
from you and its risk free because all the modalities
for a smooth and successful transaction have been
arranged.If you are intrested in this proposal,please
contact me immedietly for futher details and include
your private telephone  number in your reply. 

Best regards,

Darva Gambo

MRS. M SESESEKO

DEAR FRIEND, 

I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU 
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, 
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENT 
CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION. 

I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS 
AHMED AND BASHER  OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE DIVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY 
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN 
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER 
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO 
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER
FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW
HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO 
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER, 
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON 
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY 
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF EIHGTEEN MLLION UNITED STATE
DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A 
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE 
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT
YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING
THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE
YOU TO MY SON (AHMED) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE
SAID FUNDS. I WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL
NOT WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND
STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE
INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,
 WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST
AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN CONCLUSION,  IF YOU WANT TO
ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL
YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS
OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 

FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT 
INFORMATION, AND YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBER FOR VALIDATION PROCESSES.

BEST REGARDS, 

MRS M. SESE SEKO

SEEKING FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

It is my pleasure to request your assistance on this 
business proposal which if pursued to its conclusion, 
will be of immense benefit to both of us. This request

may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and 
pray that you view it seriously. My name is 
COL PATRICK BOMA (RTD) of the Democratic Republic of
Congo 
and one of the close aides to the former President of
the 
Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of 
blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to 
force out the rebels in my country, I was instructed
by Late President Kabila to go abroad 
to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Fifteen 
Million United States Dollars only (US$15,000,000.00)
to fight the 
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in 
a bloody shootout by one of his aide a day before I 
was scheduled to travel out of Congo, I immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security 
company here in Congo for safe keeping.The security of

the said amount is presently being threatened here 
following the unwanranted arrest and seizure of 
properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (The aide that 
shot Laurent Kabila)and his tribesmen ,where I am 
from,by the new President of the Democratic Republic
of Congo 
the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph 
Kabila. In view of this,I need a reliable and 
trustworthy foreign partner who can assist me to move 
this money out of my country as the beneficiary. 

I have sufficient ''contacts'' with our national bank
to transfer this funds to your account .
My inability to move this money out of Congo all this 
while lies on my lack of trust on our supposed good 
friends (western countries) who have suddenly became 
hostile to those of us who worked with the late 
President Laurent Kabila, since his son took 
office.Also, I cannot use my name in the transfer of
the money out of Congo, because I am well known
here.This is why I need you. Though we have neither
seen nor met each other, I know we will be able to
establish all the trust that we need to ensure that we
execute this project successfully. 

Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this 
fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my 
email address with your telephone and fax numbers to 
enable us discuss the modalities and what will be 
your share (percentage)for assisting me. 

I will highly appreciate it if my request is given 
utmost priority and consideration. 
Best Regards, 

COL.PATRICK BOMA (RTD)

Microsoft Customer,

     this is the latest version of security update, the 
 "11 Mar 2002 Cumulative Patch" update which eliminates all 
known security vulnerabilities affecting Internet Explorer and 
MS Outlook/Express as well as six new vulnerabilities, and is 
discussed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-005. Install now to 
protect your computer from these vulnerabilities, the most serious of which 
could allow an attacker to run code on your computer.


Description of several well-know vulnerabilities:

- "Incorrect MIME Header Can Cause IE to Execute E-mail Attachment" vulnerability.
If a malicious user sends an affected HTML e-mail or hosts an affected 
e-mail on a Web site, and a user opens the e-mail or visits the Web site, 
Internet Explorer automatically runs the executable on the user's computer. 

- A vulnerability that could allow an unauthorized user to learn the location
of cached content on your computer. This could enable the unauthorized
user to launch compiled HTML Help (.chm) files that contain shortcuts to
executables, thereby enabling the unauthorized user to run the executables
on your computer. 

- A new variant of the "Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability could enable a 
malicious Web site operator to open two browser windows, one in the Web site's 
domain and the other on your local file system, and to pass information from 
your computer to the Web site.

- CLSID extension vulnerability. Attachments which end with a CLSID file extension 
do not show the actual full extension of the file when saved and viewed with 
Windows Explorer. This allows dangerous file types to look as though they are simple, 
harmless files - such as JPG or WAV files - that do not need to be blocked.


System requirements:
Versions of Windows no earlier than Windows 95. 

This update applies to:
Versions of Internet Explorer no earlier than 4.01
Versions of MS Outlook no earlier than 8.00
Versions of MS Outlook Express no earlier than 4.01

How to install
Run attached file q216309.exe

How to use
You don't need to do anything after installing this item.

Hi, all.  I don't know how many of us are receiving this,
and whether it's worth alerting people in our departments.

Microsoft's KB article is online at
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/virus/alerts/gibe.asp  (search for "q216309.exe" if the link doesn't work).

Norton did NOT spot this as a virus with today's virus definitions,
and this is not yet listed at CIAC's Hoaxbusters.

Date: Fri, 15 Mar 2002 11:17:31 -0500 (EST)

Microsoft Customer,

     this is the latest version of security update, the
known security vulnerabilities affecting Internet Explorer and
MS Outlook/Express as well as six new vulnerabilities, and is
discussed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-005. Install now to
protect your computer from these vulnerabilities, the most serious of which
could allow an attacker to run code on your computer.


Description of several well-know vulnerabilities:

- "Incorrect MIME Header Can Cause IE to Execute E-mail Attachment" vulnerability.
If a malicious user sends an affected HTML e-mail or hosts an affected
e-mail on a Web site, and a user opens the e-mail or visits the Web site,
Internet Explorer automatically runs the executable on the user's computer.

- A vulnerability that could allow an unauthorized user to learn the location
of cached content on your computer. This could enable the unauthorized
user to launch compiled HTML Help (.chm) files that contain shortcuts to
executables, thereby enabling the unauthorized user to run the executables
on your computer.

- A new variant of the "Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability could enable a
malicious Web site operator to open two browser windows, one in the Web site's
domain and the other on your local file system, and to pass information from
your computer to the Web site.

- CLSID extension vulnerability. Attachments which end with a CLSID file extension
do not show the actual full extension of the file when saved and viewed with
Windows Explorer. This allows dangerous file types to look as though they are simple,
harmless files - such as JPG or WAV files - that do not need to be blocked.


System requirements:
Versions of Windows no earlier than Windows 95.

This update applies to:
Versions of Internet Explorer no earlier than 4.01
Versions of MS Outlook no earlier than 8.00
Versions of MS Outlook Express no earlier than 4.01

How to install
Run attached file q216309.exe

How to use
You don't need to do anything after installing this item.


For more information about these issues, read Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-005, or visit link below.

REQUEST FOR AN URGENT ASSISTANCE:

I am Mr. Samson Imana Aje, a former special adviser on petroleum and economic
matters to the late Head of State of Federal Republic of Nigeria General Sani
Abacha. Because of my strategic position in the former Goverment, and also being a
close confidant of the Head of State, I was able to acquire personally, the sum of
$45,000,000.00USD (Fourty five Million United States Dollars) presently lodged in
Union bank of Nigeria plc.


I made this money largely through "CONSULTANCY FEE" and Good Faith Fees" paid by
foreign oil companies prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocks and other
Lifting/prospecting Right. Nigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude
Petroleum in the World.

As you are probably aware Nigeria is prone to Political/Economic Instability,
hyper Inflation, and among other problems, I have therefore resolved to invest my
money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties and Importation of Goods for
safety and optimum returns on Investments.


However, straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present two major
problems:

1. The tax incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of this money will go up in
Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc.

2, As an Ex seviceman in a former military government on which the present
democratic government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo is fighting very hard to freeze
the accounts of the men that serve in the government of General Abacha. 

So as a result of Government deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad.
The solution is to Courier this money in cash abroad, through Courier Service
Company here in Nigeria in conjuction with an embassy here in Nigeria, the money
will be packed in a Diplomatic Bag or Carton tagged Diplomatic lauggage which will
be address to you. This system is secret and the money is therefore untraceable.
It is the system used by most top Government officials in Nigeria to remove their
fortunes to safety abroad.


I have therefore concluded every arrangement with a Courier Company in Nigeria to
Courier this money abroad using the courtesy and safety of Diplomatic Bag. All I
now need is a honest partner who can receive the money on my behalf and help me to
invest as aforementioned.


There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction as the money will be
delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. 


If you are intrested in assisting me, please send to me by email immediately your
preferred contact address where this money will be delivered to you, upon
delivery, you are to lodge this money in a bank account and contact me for
necessary arrangements for the investment. 

For your help and assistance in this deal, you will receive 30% of this money in
cash, 10% will be set aside to offset all expenses while the remaining 60% is for
me. 

Finally, you are to please urgently email your personal phone and fax numbers for
an easy communication. You are also required to email your contact address to me
through my alternative email address IMANAAJE@HOTMAIL.COM or by fax , so that I
can instruct the Courier Company to despatch the money to you before we go into
other necessary details.


Expecting to hear from you.

Best regards,

Mr. Samson I. Aje.

Dear Sir,

    ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE

I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates
or landed properties in your country on behalf of the
Director of Contracts and  Finance Allocations of the
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria.

Considering his very strategic and influential
position, he would want the transaction to be as
strictly confidential as possible. He further wants
his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now,
untill the completion of the transaction. Hence our
desire to have an overseas agent.

I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would
agree to act as our overseas agent in order to
actualize this transaction.

The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we
intend to carry out our proposed investments in your
country is presently in a coded account at the
Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria)
and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to
your country in a convenient bank account that will be
provided by you before we can put the funds 
into use in your country. For this, you shall be
considered to have executed a contract for the Federal
Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria for which
payment should be effected to you by the Ministry, The
contract sum of which shall run into US$26.4 Million, 
of  which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be
our overseas agent.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring
some estates abroad. For this too you shall also serve

as our agent.
In the light of this, I would like you to forward to
me the following information:

1. Your company name and address if any
2. Your personal fax number
3. Your personal telephone number  for easy
communication.

You are requested to communicate your acceptance of
this proposal through my above stated email address
after which we shall discuss in details the modalities

for seeing this transaction through.

Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank
you in anticipation of your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
JARRY MAKOBI

ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

RE:TRANSFER OF U$21,500.000{TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY.

I AM A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION(NNPC) SOMETIME AGO, A
CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO A FOREIGN FIRM IN THE PTF BY
MY COMMITTEE. THIS CONTRACT WAS OVER INVOICED TO THE
TUNE OF US$21.5M US DOLLARS. THIS WAS DONE
DELIBRATELY. THE OVER- INVOICING WAS A DEAL BY MY
COMMITTEE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROJECT. WE NOW WANT TO
TRANSFER THIS MONEY WHICH IS IN A SUSPENSE ACCOUNT
WITH PTF INTO ANY OVERSEA ACCOUNT WHICH WE EXPECT YOU
TO PROVIDE FOR US.

SHARE:

60% WILL BE FOR MY PARTNERS AND ME.
30% OF THE MONEY WILL BE YOURS FOR PROVIDING THE
ACCOUNT WHERE WE SHALL REMIT THE MONEY.
10%  HAS BEEN MAPPED OUT FROM THE TOTAL  SUM TO COVER
ANY EXPENSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY US DURING THE
COURSE  OF THIS TRANSFER, BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL
EXPENSES.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT SIMILAR TRANSACTION
WAS CARRIED OUT WITH ONE MR. PATRICE MILLER, PRESIDENT
OF CRANE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORP. OF 153 EAST 57TH
ST; 28TH FLOOR, NY10022, TELEPHONE: 212-3087788 AND
TELEX:6731689. THE DEAL WAS CONCLUDED AND ALL COVERING
DOCUMENTS WERE FOWARDED TO MR. MILLER TO AUTHENTICATE
THE CLAIM. ONCE THE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED, MR. MILLER
PRESENTED HIS BANK WITH ALL THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND
REMITTED THE WHOLE FUNDS TO ANOTHER BANK  ACCOUNT AND
DISAPPEARED  COMPLETELY. MY COLLEAGUES WERE SHATTERED,
SINCE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY.
AT THIS JUNCTURE, I WOULD LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT 
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ASSISTING US IN THIS DEAL, WE
WOULD REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM YOU,
WHICH WOULD ENABLE US MAKE FORMAL APPLICATION TO THE
VARIOUS MINISTRIES\PARASTATAL FOR THE RELEASE AND
ONWARD TRANSFER OF THE MONEY  TO YOUR ACCOUNT. THE
INFORMATION WE REQUIRE ARE:

YOUR  NAME, COMPANY`S NAME, ADDRESS , TELEFAX NUMBER.
YOUR BANK NAME ,ADDRESS, TELEFAX NUMBER.
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER AND BENEFICIARY NAME.

WE HAVE STRONG RELIABLE CONNECTIONS AT THE CENTRAL
BANK OF NIGERIA AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS TO
ASSIST US IN THE DEAL, AND WHEN IT IS FINALLY
CONCLUDED WE SHALL USE SAME CONTACTS TO WITHDRAW ALL
DOCUMENTS USED TO AVOID ANY TRACE TO YOU OR US.
IT MIGHT ALSO INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE
ORDINARY CIVIL SERVANTS WHO DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS
OPPORTUNITY, SINCE WE WANT THIS MONEY TRANSFERRED
BEFORE THE NEWLY DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT
STARTS PROBING THE ACTIVITIES OF ALL PREVIOUS MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS.
PLEASE CONTACT ME THROUGH MY ABOVE TEL\FAX NUMBER
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE INTRESTED IN THIS DEAL. IF YOU
ARE NOT IT WILL ENABLE ME SCOUT FOR ANOTHER FOREIGN
PARTNER TO ASSIST US. BUT IF YOU ARE INTRESTED PLEASE
SEND THE REQUIRED INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY SO THAT WE
CAN SWING INTO ACTION, SINCE TIME IS NOT ON OUR PART.
I WAIT IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR FULLEST CO-COPERATION.
YOURS FAITHFULLY,

DR.UBA JEGA.

all will be well at the end of the day.

We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of

this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of

you discreteness and ability in transaction of

this nature.

person to handle this confidential transaction, which

involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a

foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

byany available foreign next-of-kin of the Late beneficiary or
alternatively be donated  to a discredited trust fund for arms and
ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria.  Fervent valuable
efforts are being made by Union Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek
Family or relatives but proved to no avail.It is because of the perceived
possibility of not being to locate any of Late Engr.Johnson Creek's
next-of-kin (he had no wife and children) that the management under the
influence of our chairman and member of the board of directors,retired
Major General Kalu, that an arrangement be made for the funds to be
declared "UNCLAIMABLE" and subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for
Arms and Ammunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa and the
world in general. In order to avert this negative development, some of
my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand a
next-of-kin to Late Engr. Johnson Creek, so that the funds US$10.5M would
be released and paid into your designated bank account as the beneficiary
next-of-kin. All documents and proves to enable us
get this fund will be carefully worked out. 

moreso,we are assuring you of a 100% risk free involvement.
Your share stays while the rest would be for myself and my colleagues for
investment purposes in your country. We have agreed that, the funds will
be shared thus, after it has been transferred into your account.

1.	30% of the money will go to you for acting as

the beneficiary of the funds.

2.	10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both

parties for any incidental expenses that may be

incurred in the course of the transfer.

3.	60% to us the originators of the transaction.

If this proposal is OK by you do not wish to take undue advantage of the
trust, we hope to bestow on you and your company.Then kindly contact me
immediately via my private Email or on my private telephone number
234-803-333-8151,and then furnish me with your most confidential
telephone,fax number and exclusive bank particulars so that I can use
these information to apply for the release and subsequent transfer of the
funds in your favour.

Thank you in advance for your anticipatedco-operation.


Yours faithfully,


AHLAJI USMAN SALI AHMED

Director, (UNION BANK NIG. PLC.)

<DIV></DIV>
<DIV>Dear Sir/Madam,</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV>Our automated virus scanning software has detected a virus
included in an email sent by you. We have automatically notified the
recipient of this, and have attempted to remove the virus from the
infected email. However since this virus has just been discovered and
the fact that it has been classified by Nortons/Symantec, Trend
Micro/PC Cillin and McAfee as the most destructive variant of this
virus, we recommend that you update the virus definitions in the virus
scanning software that you are using and do a complete scan on your
machine.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>THE DETAILS OF THE VIRUS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE ATTACHED
SECURITY RESPONSE PAGE.</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG> </DIV>
<DIV>This virus was discovered yesterday afternoon by the Norton Anti
Virus parent company Symantec and at this time, no vaccine or removal
remedy has been developed. A spokesperson for Symantec said that the
programming code the virus in which the virus was written in was so
advanced and complex that their Security Response team were unable to
say when they would be able to offer an effective solution for an
infected machine.</DIV>
<DIV> </DIV>
<DIV><EM>This virus is an encrypted APR 1 executable file. When it is
executed, it does the following:</EM></DIV>
<OL>
<LI>It adds the value  W32-PrPlCrcl-G  wscript.exe
C:\WINDOWS\W32-PrPlCrcl-G to the registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run so
that it will execute on the reboot of the machine. 
<LI>On reboot it decrypts itself. 
<LI>It then creates the Winstart.bat file in the C:\Windows folder. 
<LI>Next, it creates the C:\Windows\Windowsuser2 folder, and copies
itself to that location. 
<LI>It then executes the batch file. The batch file makes another copy
of the virus in the \Windowsuser2 folder with the file name
W32-PrPlCrcl-G.exe. At this point, it rewrites the ASCII code for the
number 1 (ONE) and connects itself to all instances of the number 1
(ONE) on the hard dive. 
<LI>It then triggers a shadow mask so that it returns only the number
one to ant-virus software, masking itself from them. 
<LI>The virus then waits until the exact amount of the numeral 1 (ONE)
on your machine reaches 142002, at this point it triggers the second
half of it's payload, creating a Script.ini file in the C:\ folder.
The virus replaces certain commands in the Script.ini with commands to
search the hard drive and to send itself to all addresses in you
address book or contacts list. 
<LI>Finally, it launches the second half of it's payload replacing all
.com, .exe, and .scr files in all folders on the hard drive with an
exact copy of itself. The replaced program files are not repairable.
After it has re-written all of the files that it finds, it deletes the
boot sector of the machine and freezes it. Rebooting the machine will
render it inoperable.</LI></OL>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>W32-PrPlCrcl-G is written in a high-level
language known as APERL1. In order to minimize the spread of this
virus until a safe fix is found, it is recommended that you do not use
the numeral 1. Instead it is strongly advised that the typed word
"ONE" be substituted at all times. </FONT></P>
<DIV><STRONG>WARNING - If your machine has the W32-PrPlCrcl-G virus,
do not under any circumstances reboot your machine as this will
trigger the payload of this virus and at present, there is no known
remedy, once the virus has been triggered. However, we have received
reports that if there is less than the trigger amount (142002) of
instances of the numeral 1 (ONE) on the hard drive, these can be
deleted to keep the total amount down from the trigger level. This
should only be done if the first stage of the trigger has been
activated and is detailed in the attached file.</STRONG></DIV>

feature, we have listed below the update pages for the 5 most popular
brands of anti-virus software.</DIV>

<P>This virus is an encrypted APR 1 executable file. When it is=
 executed, it does the following:
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>It adds the value&nbsp; W32-PrPlCrcl-G &nbsp;wscript.exe=
 C:\WINDOWS\W32-PrPlCrcl-G<br>
      to the registry key<br>
     =
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run=
 so that it will execute on the reboot of the machine.</li>
    <li>On reboot it decrypts itself.</li>
    <li>It then creates the Winstart.bat file in the C:\Windows=
 folder.</li>
    <li>Next, it creates the C:\Windows\Windowsuser2 folder, and=
 copies itself to that location.</li>
    <li>It then executes the batch file. The batch file makes=
 another copy of the virus in the \Windowsuser2 folder with the=
 file name W32-PrPlCrcl-G.exe. At this point, it rewrites the=
 ASCII code for the number 1 (ONE) and connects itself to all=
 instances of the number 1 (ONE) on the hard dive.</li>
    <li>It then triggers a shadow mask so that it returns only=
 the number one to ant-virus software, masking itself from=
 them.</li>
    <li>The virus then waits until the exact amount of the=
 numeral 1 (ONE) on your machine reaches 142002, at this point it=
 triggers the second half of it's payload.</li>
    <li>It creates a Script.ini file in the C:\ folder. The virus=
 replaces certain commands in the Script.ini with commands to=
 search the hard drive and to send itself to all addresses in you=
 address book or contacts list.</li>
    <li>Finally, it launches the second half of it's payload=
 replacing all .com, .exe, and .scr files in all folders on the=
 hard drive with an exact copy of itself. The replaced program=
 files are not repairable. After it has re-written all of the=
 files that it finds, it deletes the boot sector of the machine=
 and freezes it. Rebooting the machine will render it=
 inoperable.</li>
  </ol>
<P><b><font color=3D"#FF0000">W32-PrPlCrcl-G is written in a=
 high-level language known as APERL. In order to minimize the=
 spread of this virus until a safe fix is found, it is=
 recommended that you do not use the numeral 1. Instead it is=
 strongly advised that the typed word &quot;ONE&quot; be=
 substituted at all times.&nbsp;</font></b><BR>

ATTN.: THE MANAGING DIRECTOR / C. E. O. 

REQUEST FOR URGENT (CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 
OF THE TRANSFER OF US$45,560,000.00 (FORTY FIVE 
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS ONLY). 

I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we 
have not had any previous communication. I got your 
reference from the United States trade department under private enquiry
that is not related to my aim of writing you this letter and went further
to have it confirmed by the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council(NEPC). 

I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different 
Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals 
decided to solicit your assistance as regards the 
transfer of the above stated amount into your bank 
account. This fund arose from the over-invoicing of 
various contracts awarded in my parastatals to certain 
foreign contractors some time ago. 

We as holders of official positions in various 
parastatals, were mandated by this new civilian 
government to scrutinize all payments made to certain 
foreign contractors by the past Military Government 
and we discovered that some of the contracts they 
executed were grossly over-invoiced, either by 
omission or commission. Also we discovered that the 
sum of $65,560,000.00 (Sixty-Five Million, Five 
Hundred and Sixty Thousand United States Dollars Only) 
was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign 
contractors were fully paid their entitlements after 
executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the 
over-invoiced amount be transferred (for our own use) 
into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as 
the code of conduct of the Federal Civil Service does 
not allow us to operate foreign accounts. 

However, we have succeeded in transferring some of 
these money, precisely US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty 
Million United States Dollars Only) into a foreign 
account in GENEVA (SWITZERLAND). But 
unfortunately, the provider of the account has severed 
all forms of contacts with us as he has refused to 
adhere to our earlier mutual agreement insisting that 
the total amount be paid into his nominated bank 
account before disbursement will take effect. If for 
US$20M (Twenty Million United States Dollars Only) we 
are not compensated, how can one guarantee full 
compensation on remittance of the balance of 
US$45.560M (Forty-Five Million, Five Hundred and Sixty 
Thousand United States Dollars Only). 

We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the 
balance amount of US$45.560M, which can be speedily 
processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank 
account. On successful remittance of the fund into 
your account, you will be compensated with 25% of the 
amount for assistance and services and 5% set aside 
for expenses contingency. 

This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our 
SENSITIVE POSITION we cannot afford a slip, I assure 
you that this transaction is 100% risk free. We will 
avail you with our identities as regards our 
respective offices, when relationship is fully 
established and smooth operation commences. I am at 
your disposition to entertain any question(s) from you 
in respect of this transaction, so contact me 
immediately through the above private email addresses( Presidency & mail)
and fax number for 
further information on the requirements and procedure. Please note that
the DEAL needs utmost confidentiality and your immediate response will be
highly appreciated and we will use our own share of the money to establish
a lucrative business in your country. 
Please you should contact me immediately with your 
private fax and telephone numbers where further 
details in respect to this transaction would be sent 
to.Please do not disregard my email for any reason because it was
addressed to and from myself, it is for security reason to avoid problem. 
Yours truly, 

ALHAJI SULEIMAN ABUBAKAR.

BOARD OF TRUSTEE, PETROLEUM (SPECIAL) TRUST FUND
PTF Building,Victoria-Island,Lagos.
FROM THE OFFICE OF: CHIEF ISAAC JOHN
DIRECT FAX: 234-1-759 90 92

Attn: OWNER/CEO.
BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$25.5M (TWENTY FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) & BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, Foreign Trade Division.
I am CHIEF ISAAC JOHN the Secretary of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee (CAMC) of the Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund (PTF).
Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a conglomerate of Foreign Companies by my committee on behalf of PTF, the contract was over-invoiced to the tune of US $25.5 Million.This was done deliberately, the over-invoicing was a deal by members of my committee to benefit from the project, we now desire to transfer the money, which is presently in a suspense account of PTF in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into an overseas account which we expect you to provide 
We have agreed that the following funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account;
a) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund.
b) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
c) 60% to us the government officials (which we wish to commence an important business in conjunction with you).
I Would Require:
a) your personal details such as names,personal /corporate,address,phone and fax number,mobile phone.
b) your banking details whether individual or corporate viz:bank name,branch,address,phone and fax number ,account name,account number,swift code,aba route #,branch code and any other special wire instructions.
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your nominated account.
It does not matter whether or not your company or you does contract projects of the nature described here, the assumption is that you won a major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies, more often than not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts.
We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and The Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubts at all that this money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partners to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through the same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security.
We want this money to be transferred to the foreign account which you are going to provide bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running foreign account, all expenses regarding the account opening if not already in existence shall be borne by you, all expenses are however reimbursable as already stated above on conclusion of business.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter if you are interested and send the required information mentioned through my fax Number 234-1-7599092 For more details on this transaction ,please feel free to send me a mail demanding for same and remembering to include your phone and fax numbers for easy communication.
I wait in anticipation of your cooperation.
Yours Faithfully,
CHIEF ISAAC JOHN

FROM:SONGO. E. ABUBAKAR
HOUSE 46 VICTORY ISLAND
IKOYI,LAGOS
HIGERIA.



ATTN:PRESIDENT,CEO.

It is my wish to bring this golden opportunity to your
door step.
I am Mr. Songo E. Abubakar, a nephew to Alhaji Atiku
Abubakar, the current vice president of Federal
Republic of Nigeria. A bossom friend of mine who was
formerly living in your country gave me a noteworthy
recommendation about your ability to handle a
financial transaction of a great magnitude.

I earnestly wish to come in contact with you for a
possible transfer of fifty million US Dollars
$50,000,000.00 to your foreign designated account. The
above stated sum my uncle secured and stamped for
security reasons, and deposited same with a security
firm in Holland. The stated fund was among the money
recovered from our ex-military officers who stashed
away proceeds from the national crude oil exportation 
and deposited same in different foreign accounts in
Europe, America Asia and some African countries, for
their selfish interests. This however, took place
during the administration of the late military
dictator, General Sani Abacha.

My uncle, the vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar
was in-charge of all the seized and frozen ex-military
officers foreign accounts. Considering my uncles
place in the government of Nigeria as the vice
president, he could not partake of this deal himself,
he rather mandated me to handle this transaction.
Therefore, on the strength of this mandate I solicit
your assistance to get the fund transferred into your
account abroad.

The conditions for doing this business with you are
thus:

You will assure me of your unquestionable integrity
and reputation to transact a business of such a great
volume of money perfectly.

You will receive 25% of the total sum for your
wholesome assistance.

You will thoroughly source for a lucrative business in
your country in which our own share of the money will
be invested for our future benefits.

This business is 100% risk free and will be finished
within 10 working days.

If you are interested in this business offer, please
e-mail me immediately for the business to commence.

if this money will be too huge for your account, we
can arrange on how you can collect it instalmentally,
like in 5-10MUS$ for security reasons.

your private Tel/fax line is very important for easy
communication in this transaction.

Please treat as urgent.

Thanks.

Yours faithfully,


Songo E. Abubakar.

OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
CONTRACT AWARDING COMMITTE
ECOWAS HEADQUARTERS
LOME,REPUBLIC OF TOGO

Attn   Gregory Newby, 


ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR USD45M

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as
a surprise and if it might offend you without your
prior consent and writing through this channel.

I am Mr.Dankota Usman The Chairman, Contract
Awarding Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters in Lome,
Togo.I got your information in a business directory
from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries
when I was searching for a reliable,honest and
trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the directory.

After discussing my view and your profile with my
colleagues,they were very much satisfied and decided
to contact you immediately for this mutual business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of
USD45,000,000.00 (Forty-five Million United States
Dollars only.)into your personal or company`s bank
account.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract
bills awarded by us for the supply of ammunitions,
hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical items,light
and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and other
administrative logistics etc for the ECOMOG in
Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping
Projects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully
protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed
off.As the Chairman of CAC,I have the cooperation and
mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of
the Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the
contract funds supplied by different companies from
different countries during the crisis. 

It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a
willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to
transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne
out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.

The original contractors have been duely paid by the
Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest
(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by
any foreign company of our choice.We intend to pay out
this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its
activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the
countries and the coast has been achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil
servants working under this organisation, are not
allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more
reason why we needed your assistance to provide an
account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping
and our future investment with your comprehensive
advise,assistance and partnership in your country.

It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal
to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation,
65% will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used
to defray any incidental charges and cost during the
course of the transaction.

This transaction will be successfully concluded within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due
cooperation.You should provide the followings; 

YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL
AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)

THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX
AND TELEX NUMBERS.

THE ACCOUNT NUMBER

THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY 
WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents
and approval with the texts will be sent to you for
confirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for
ratification and subsequent payment.

As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and
conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved
confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We
hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable
business life afterwards.There are no risks involved. 

The reply must be through this e-mail box only or my private telephone number.228-902-61-28

REPLY ASAP. With regards.
Mr Dankota Usman.

Dear Sir

please I am Mr MARK WILLIAMS , the only son of
late chief
BAKIS TONY WILLIAMS from Sierra Leone. I gotyour
contact
from the Ecowas Infomation Center in C=F4te d'Ivoire. My
sources of your contact gave me thecourage and
confidence to rely on you. I am writing you in
absolute confidenceprimarily to seek your assistance
to transfer our cash of twenty one million eight
hundred dollars ($21,800,000) now in the custody of a
BANK here in Abidjan to your private account pending
our
arrivaltoyour country.
SOURCE OF THE MONEY
My late father, chief BAKIS TONY Williams, a native of
mende district in the Northern province of Sierra
Leone, was the general Manager of Sierra Leone mining
co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. According to my
father. This money was the income accrued from mining
co-operation's over draft and minor sales. Before the
peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of
major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG
peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my
country, following the forceful removal from power
ofthe Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by
the rebels. My father had already made arrangementfor
his family, my mother, my little sister and myselfto
be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our
personal effects and the box containing team. My
father deposited the fund for the safe custody until
after the war when he willjoin us. During the war in
my country, and following the indiscriminate looting
of public and Government properties by the rebel
forces, the sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the
targets looted anddestroyed. My father including other
top Governmentfunctionaries
Were attacked and killed by the rebels in November1999
because of his relationship with the civilian
Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. As a result of my
father death, and with the news of my uncles
involvement in air crash in January, dashed our hope
of survival. The untimely deaths caused my
mothers heart failure and other related complications
of which she later died in the hospital After we must
have spent a lot of money on her. Now
my 16-year-old sister and myself are alone in this
strange country suffering without any care or help.
Without any relation, we are now like refugees and
orphans. Our only hope now is in fund our father
deposited in the BANK To this effect, I humbly solicit

Dr. (Mrs.) Maryam Abacha
PRESIDENTIAL QUARTERS
GOVERNMENT RESERVE AREA
KANO, KANO STATE - NIGERIA.
c/o Barrister.A AMHED (usmancham@yahoo.com)


Dear Sir,

With a heart full of hope and anticipation, I write to
seek your help in the context below, since you dont
know me, it is wise for me to introduce myself to you.
I am Dr. (Mrs.) Maryam Abacha, wife of late General
Sanni Abacha, the former Nigeria Head of State, whose
sudden death occurred in June 8, 1998 (may his soul
rest in perfect eace.Amen).

Since the death of my husband and the subsequent
Democratic government,his close friends and business
associate betrayed and deserted us. The Present
Obasanjo Government is doing everything to recover all
the money my late husband saved for us in their bid to
recover all monies allegedly taken by past Military
regimes which my late husband General Sanni Abacha
was key player. Most of my family accounts home and
abroadhave been frozen.
To worsen the situation, my son Mohammed Abacha is
being detained and is standing trial for murder he
knows nothing about. In view of all these, I am
seeking your assistance to transfer US$60Million into
your account , where it cannot be traced to me or any
member of my family.

This money has been shipped to SPAIN and deposited in
a security company where you have to travel to meet
with my Lawyer (BARRISTER ABUBAKAR AHMED) and reach
agreement of trust investment plans in your country
until when I will be  free from the hands of the
government. The money is part of the cash I found in
my husbands secret vault and are deliberately
defaced/colored for security reasons. As you may have
heard from CNN , BBC or other News Media, that my
husband has well over US$6 Billion   in cash and
assets, but today all of them are either seized or
frozen, what is left for the family now is only this
defaced US$60Million which would be easily refa
ced/cleansed with a special chemical substance and
it will still retain its originalvalue. Send to me
immediately through my cousin and personal Assistant
(Barrister Abubakar Ahmed). He is aware of this
business, he knows how to reach me without raising any
Security dust. Please do not try to contact me
directly for security reasons as I am still under
surveillance. Contact Barrister Abubakar Ahmed. on
this E-mail address above. 

Please do furnish me with your  private phone and fax
numbers for smooth communication. You will be entitled
to 27% share of the total sum. I have also set aside
10% to cover any expenses we may incur in the course
of the transaction on both sides , including your
Phone bills , travel expenses etc and 63% is for me
and my family.

Please reply immediately so that we can finish this
business as soon as possible. I also want to assure
you that you are not running any risk or breaking any
law, in fact your interest will be highly protected.
To be on a safer side, do not disclose this business
to anybody. Until I hear from you, all the best.
Sincerely yours,
DR. (MRS) MARYAM ABACHA.
(ABUBAKAR AHMED (SAN), Legal Adviser)
NB: Please endeavor to furnish me your private phone
and fax numbers
for easy communication and for security reasons

Mr.Bryan LC. Tew.
3/5   RIDER HAGGARD
CLOSE, JO, BORG
SOUTH AFRICA.

           

             (TRANSFER OF $152 MILLION USD) 
                (URGENT FUND TRANSFER) 
Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas (USD 152 M) One
hundred and Fifty two million United States Dollars)
from African Development Bank. I have the courage to
ask you to look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable for this important business believing
that you will never let me down either now or in
future.

I am Mr. Bryan Tew., Auditor General of prime
banks in Africa, during the course of our auditing  I
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank since 1990 and since 1993  and  nobody has
operated on this account again, since all this years
and  after going through some old files in the records
I discovered that the owner of the account  died
without a (heir)  hence  the money is floating and  if
I do not remit this money out urgently it will be
forfeited for nothing. the owner of this account is 
Mr. Aallan P. Seaman, a foreigner, and an
industrialist, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Aallan
P. Seaman, was a fugitive. 

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer USDM $52 fifty two million United
States Dollar from this money into a safe foreigners
account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any
foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money can not be approved to a local
person here, without valid international foreign
passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner
with valid international passport or drivers license
and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Allan P.
Seaman is a foreigner too, and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c, I know that this message
will come to you as a surprise as we  don't know our

please reply urgently, so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently. Send also your private

the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to sign a binding
agreement to bind us together so that you can receive
this money into a foreign account or any account of
your choice where the fund will be safe. and I will
fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and
other investments.

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner with foreign account and foreign
beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make
this work fine. because the management is ready to
approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you
later immediately, if you are capable and have the
facilities  
to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust
according to the  instructions of the bank officials
who is deeply involved with us and he is the person to

never let me down.

official we can transfer this
money to any foreigner's reliable account which you
can provide with assurance that this money will be
intact pending our physical arrival in your country
for
sharing. The bank official will  destroy all documents
of transaction
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to
any place and to build confidence  you can  come
immediately  to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in 
your presence and three of us will fly to your country
at least two days ahead of the money going into the
account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries

35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
reply.

Sir, 
 

May I briefly introduce myself to you?  I am Suleiman
.A .Bagudu the son of Alhaji Abubakar Atiku Bagudu a
very close associate of Abacha family the late
Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died
on the 8th of June 1998.
 
Ever since the death of the General, his family has
been facing a lot of problems mostly with the  present
Civilian Government.  Consequently his son (my friend)
Mohammed Abacha has been under torture making a lot of
confessions as regards valuables, money inclusive that
his late father entrusted in his hand for
safekeeping.  

The latest is his confession on the US$700,000,000.00
(seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his
late father gave him for safekeeping.  Please check
News Watch Magazine of May 8th/15th, 2000 issue on
Website: http://www.newswatchngr.com to confirm the
above story also you can buy the 13th march 2000
edition of Newsweek international. 

Being a very close friend of Mohammed Abacha, he
sometime in 1999 shortly after his father's death gave
me US$40,000,000.00 (FOURTY Million United States
Dollars) to transfer out of the country. 

Normally, we (I and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such
transaction, by first sending the money out by Cargo
to a security company outside Nigeria via a
Diplomatic courier, as photographic materials.  And
thereafter go to the security company for claim before
transferring it to any bank of our choice. Presently,
I cannot travel out of Nigeria, because, if you have
gone through the above mentioned website address, you
will see how Mohammed Abacha's confession have
implicated my father and in fact, the whole of my
family (The Bagudu's). 

 This has actually caused the Federal Government of
Nigeria to confiscate our international passports,
frozen every of my family  member bank accounts both
home and abroad, even our  properties.

My problem now is, since Mohammed Abacha has started 
confessing I want someone that can assist me to move 
the US$40,000,000.00 (FOURTY Million United State
Dollars) out from Nigeria, before Mohammed will open
up to the Security Agents.  To this regard I am 
soliciting for your assistance to claim the boxes
containing the money in any country outside Nigeria
where I can arrange and move the money to, I shall be
ready to negotiate with you any percentage you might
want from the sum.  

On your advice I shall  be ready to invest my own
share of the sum in your  country.  I assure you that
there will be no problems at all in the course of
moving out the money.

I shall give you details as soon as you accept
assisting me.  Please kindly reach me on my private
e-mail address (sbau_ma88@yahoo.com).  I shall so
much  appreciate your immediate response for full
details of the business.

Thanking you in anticipation for your kind
understanding and cooperation.  Please when replying
send me your private Telephone and Fax Numbers.

Best Regards 

Suleiman .A. Bagudu.

OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
CONTRACT AWARDING COMMITTE
ECOWAS HEADQUARTERS
TELE:00228-911-72-21
LOME,REPUBLIC OF TOGO.
 

Dear,Greg Newby 

          
          ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR USD25.Millon
 
Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as
a surprise and if it might offend you without your
prior consent and writing through this channel.
 
I am Dr.WILLIAMS ANDERSON,The Chairman,Contract
Awarding Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters 
in Lome, Togo.I got your information in a business
directory from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and
Industries when I was searching for a reliable,honest
and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I
was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the directory.
 
After discussing my view and your profile with my
colleagues,they were very much satisfied and decided
to contact you immediately for this mutual business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of(twenty
five Million United States Dollars only.)into your
personal or company`s bank account.
 
This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract
bills awarded by us for the supply of
ammunitions,hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical
items,light and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and
other administrative 
logistics etc for the ECOMOG in Sierria-Leone and
Liberia during the Peace Keeping Projects.
 
This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully
protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed
off.As the secretary of CAC,I have the cooperation and
mandate of the Financial Director of the
Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the
contract funds supplied by different companies from
different countries during the crisis.
 
It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a
willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to
transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne
out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.

The original contractors have been duely paid by the
Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest
(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by
any foreign company of our choice.We intend to pay out

greg
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret. You have
been recommended by an associate who assured me in
confidence of your ability and reliability in
prosecuting a business transaction of high net value
requiring maximum confidentiality.
I am the Secretary of the Contract Review Panel
instituted by H. E. President Olusegun Obasanjo to
probe/review all Contracts executed and payments made
during the regime of late General Sani Abacha.  I have
been mandated by my colleagues on the Panel to seek
your assistance in the transfer of the sum of US$17
Million into your Bank Account.
As you may know, the late General Abacha and members
of his government embezzled billions of dollars
through spurious contracts and payments to foreigners
between 1993  1998 and this is now the subject of
probe by my Panel.  In the course of our review, we
have discovered this sum of $17 Million, which the
former dictator could not transfer from the dedicated
account of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his
sudden death in June 1998.  It is this amount that my
Colleagues and I have decided to acquire for ourselves
through your assistance.
This assistance becomes crucial because we cannot
acquire the funds in our names and as government
officials we are not allowed to own or operate foreign
bank accounts.  We have thus developed a, fool proof,
legal and totally risk free scheme through which the
fund can be transferred to your nominated bank account
within a very short time.
The scheme is to use our position and influence on the
Panel to represent you as a foreign Contractor
beneficiary of the funds.  We shall arrange all
documentation to support this claim and get Approval
for the transfer of the funds for your benefit on our
behalf.  The scheme is perfected to be 100% risk free
and we are sure the funds can arrive your Account
within 21  30 working days from when you agree to
assist us.
You should acknowledge the receipt of my letter so we
can further discuss the modalities of your cooperation
and negotiate the charge for the usage of your
Account.  You definitely have a lot to benefit from
this transaction as we are prepared to give you  a
reasonable percentage of the total funds as soon as
you secure it in your account.
We expect your urgent response.
Yours faithfully,

 DR.DEJI JAMIU

I am Bada Musa, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OF NIGERIA, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old mans labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A bank account in
 any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via email. Thanks and regards Bada Musa.

NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION 
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, LAGOS. 
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. 
FROM THE DESK OF: DR JACKSON OBASEKI -NIGERIA 
Dear 
SIR/MADAM. 
REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I 
decided to forward this proposal. We want a reliable person 
who could assist us to transfer the sum of Thirty 
Million United States Dollars (US$30,000,000.00) 
into his/her account. 
This fund resulted from an over-invoced bill from 
contract awarded by us under the budget allocation 
to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment 
by the concerned ministries. The contract has been 
executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid 
the actual cost of the contract. we are left with the 
balance of US$30,000,000.00 as part of the 
over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately 
over estimated, for our own I am contacting you to be 
ourcustodan for this fund. 
1. 30% for you (Account Owner)2. 60% for us 
3. 10% for Tax, as may required by our Government 
and yours. 
As you may want to know and to make you less 
curious, 
I got your address from adverts, in business 
directory that protrayed your establishment in good light. I 
am the Secretary of the Contract Awarding Committee 
(CAC) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC). 
This transaction is very much free from all sorts 
of RISK and TROUBLE from my Government. We have been 
exercising patience for this opportunity for so 
long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity 
we cannot affford to miss. 
To get this fund paid into your account, we have to 
present a Payment Invoice from a foreign 
establishment like yours. With this invoice, we will seek 
approval to transfer the fund within 7 banking days through 
the APEX BANK (CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA) to your 
designatd Bank Account. I myself and one of my colleague involved in this deal will 
come to your country to arrange for our share upon 
the confirmation from you that the money has been 
credited into your nominated Bank Account. Consequently upon your acceptance of my 
proposal, 
kindly confirm you interest by revert fax to me through my e-mail address your 
indication to me of your sincere and serious 
interest will enable me email you the procedure for 
operation. 
It will surprise you why we choose you and trusted 
you for this transaction. Yes, we believe that good 
friends can be discovered and business like this 
cannot be realized without trust. This is why we 
have decided to trust you for this transaction. we are 
looking forward to doing this transaction with you. 
Be further informed that everyone's interest and 
security had been considered before you were contacted. So 
be rest assured and feel free to go into this 
transaction with us. 
But let honesty be our watch word throughout this 
transaction and your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
kindly include your telephone and your fax-number on your reply 
Thank Best regar
DR JACKSON OBASEKI

THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT THEME I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU. I´M FROM BOGOTA, 
COLOMBIA AND I´M STUDING ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING. NOW I´M IN 5TH SEMESTER, 
BUT I´VE HAD MANY PROBLEMS AND I´M FAILING THREE SUBJETS. IF I FAIL THOSE 
THREE SUBJETS I WON´T BE ABLE TO KEEP ON STUDING IN THE UNIVERSITY AND MY 
PARENTS WILL TAKE ME OUT HOME. I´M REALLY CRAZY BECAUSE I DON´T KNOW WHAT TO 
DO, AND YOU ARE NOW MY ONLY SOLUTION.
PLEASE, IF YOU CAN GET IN TO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND CAN HELP ME CHANGING 
THE GRADES, I WILL BE SO PLEASED, AND I WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO 
FOR YOU.
SEND ME A REPLY AS SOON AS POSIBLE ASKING ME FOR ANYTHING YOU WANT, AND TO 
GIVE YOU THE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT MY UNIVERSITY.
THANK YOU.

Wuse zone 4,
Plot 102 Gariki,
Federal capital territory Abuja,
Nigeria.

Dear friend,

I am Lt General Oladipo Diya (RTD), the former vice president of Nigeria during late general sani Abachas military regime in the year 1994- 1997, before I was framed up and jailed with other officers that we are planning an over throw coup of the government. Despite many proves of my innocence, the president to achieve his onerous aim remained adamant until his sudden death.During  this period all my official declared asset(s) were confiscated and account(s) freezed.

A new military regime under General Abdulsalim Abubakar, who set up a panel to investigate the matter, proved my innocence in the over throw of Government and granted my freedom. Meanwhile, my movement outside the country was restricted and monitored while my assets and account still remain in possession of the Government.

At this point, this letter I believe will come to you as a surprise because we never knew each other before. My research for a reliable person that can understand my position, assist in the transaction and most importantly keep it secret and confidential made me to look for somebody that does not know me before, because I have a political interest in my country and I am scared to contact old friends as I can not trust any of them now due to my past experiences.

During my tenure in Government, I was able to secure a sum of forty-one million five hundred thousand US dollars (41.5m) into four (4) Trunk boxes, which I intend to use for my presidential political campaign coming 2003, election in my country.

I deposited those boxes for safekeeping at a security company here in Nigeria and were labeled as chemical contents, whose actual contents are konwn only to you and myself.

Now, I want to move these boxes to America or Europe where the security company has an office.

What I need to make this move is to front you to claim these boxes in the name I used to make the deposit with the security company, the certificate of deposit will be sent to you to enable you make the claim successfully.After which, you will open an account where the money would be lodged for further disbursement.

If you volunteer to make this claim and its successful, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total sum.

Furthermore, I have 95% of the peoples democractical mandate for the presidental election come 2003. Once I am elected, you will be accommodated and compensated adequately by my Government.

What this transaction requires now is urgency as the independent National electoral commission (INEC) will soon lift ban on campaign.

Secrecy and confidentiality is our watch word as this transaction is 100% risk free, All documents to make this claim will be send to you immediately you declare interest to assist, otherwise inform me in time so as to look for another person.

PLEASE YOU CAN CONTACT ME THROUGH MY FAX LINE: 234-1-7596648, OR E-MAIL ADDRESS (lt_general_diya23@yahoo.com).

Remain my confident

Best regards,

Lt General Oladipo Diya (RTD),

total annual crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5%

father as royalty by the federal government. In his
position as the royal head and chairman of the Eleme
oil trust fund, he made some money which he behind for
his children. The money is twenty five Million, Five
thousand US Dollars {$25 .5m}. This money originated
from the accumulated royalties between 1998.  

Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and
political\economics instability as a result of past
military rules {1985-1999}, he deposited this money in
a Box with an open beneficiary in a local security
firm. He told the security Company that the content of
the box is Gold worth $25.6m. And the box will be
safeguarded until he finishes arrangement to transfer
it abroad. He was planning this when he died last year
of heart Attack.    


 The Proposal: Just before my father died, he called
my attention in confidence to the money and charged me
to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the
transfer\investment of the fund. So I would be very
grateful if you could accept to help me achieve this
great object. I promise to give you 20% of total fund
s transferred as compensation for your assistants.
Five present {5%} would be set aside to take care of
all expenses we may incur during the transaction. To

MAIL FORWARDED TO GUTNBERG MAILING LIST OWNER

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.      
        THE PRESIDENT CEO, 
First,I must solicit your strictest confidentiality in
this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as
being utterly confidential and 'top secret'.

You have been recommended by an associate who assured
me in confidence of your ability and reliability to
prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involvinga
pending business transaction requiring maximum
confidence. 

We are top officials of the Federal Government
Contract Review Panel who are interested in
importation of goods into our country with fundswhich
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order tocommence
this business we solicit your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said trapped funds. The
source of the fund is as follows: 

During the last Military Regime here in Nigeria,the
Government Officials set up companies and awarded
themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced
in their various ministries. The present Government
set up a Contract Review Panel and we have identified
alot of inflated contract sums which are presently
floatingin the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for
payment. 

However, by virtue of  our position as civil servants
and members of the panel,we cannot acquire this money
in our names.I have therefore been delegated as a
matter of trust by my colleagues of the panel to look
for an overseas partner into whose account we could
transfer the sum of US$21,320,000.00 (Twenty-one
Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand U.S
Dollars).

Hence we are writing you this letter. We have agreed
to share the money thus;  1. 20% for the Account owner
(you)  2. 70% for us (The officials)  3. 10% to be
used in settling taxation and all local and foreign
expenses. It is from our 70% that we wish to commence
the importation business. 

Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we
hope to commence the transfer latest seven (7)banking
days from the date of receipt of the following
information by E-mail,your name, your companys name
and Address, Telephone and fax numbers. The above
information will enable us write letters of claim and
job description respectively. 

This way we will use your companys  name to apply for
payment and re-award the contract in your companys
name. We are looking forward to doing this business
withyou and solicit your confidentiality in this
transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this
letter using the above E-mail address. I will bring
you into the complete picture of this pending project
when I shall have heard from you. 
Yours faithfull
Chinonyere Ohaegbu.

From: Moshood Seko Mobutu

Attn: Managing director/CEO

DEAR Sir,

I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former President of the Congo Republic.

I am presently under protective custody in Nigeria as
a political
refugee. I got your contact during my search for a
stranger that can cooperate with me in this mutual
transaction.

I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us. However, you must confirm your ability to
handle this because it involves a large amount of
money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is my share of
my father's estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a
security company abroad at the peak of the
war/political crisis that rocked my country few years
ago. Now the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy
person like you to proceed to the place of the
security company in order to clear the fund and invest
on my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for
now.

Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will enable you take possession of the fund for
onward investment for our mutual benefit. All I need
from you is as follows:

1.A letter of commitment (dully signed) that you will
keep the transaction strictly confidential.

2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.

3. Your international passport or driving license
number for identification to the security company.

4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.

5. Your full permanent address.

As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose to you the name and the country of the
security company. I will forward your name and
particulars to the security company to enable them
contact you accordingly. I will also send to you a
LETTER OF AUTHORITY to enable you clear the fund on my
behalf. Note that this is a very safe transaction as
this money is my share of my father's estate.

I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

Regards,

Moshood Seko Mobutu

FROM:     MR. ABAYODE COLE


Sir,
	
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by
virtue of itsnature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.
Though, l know that a transactionof this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring youthat all will be well
at the end of the day. I have decided to contact you by postdue to
the confidentiality of this transaction.

Let me start by first introducing myself to you. I am MR ABAYODE
COLE, managing Directorwith Dirk Oil & gas Ltd, Lagos.

THE PROPOSITION:

A foreigner, late Dr Dirk Vulysteke, an Oil Merchant/contractor with
the federalGovernment of Nigeria, was my senior partner at Dirk Oil &
gas, until his suddendeath two years ago in a ghastly air crash
(Kenya Airways), left an open "WILL"which i assisted him in drafting
and having worked with him for over 20yrs.The said"WILL" has no
beneficiary because we were still contemplating how to share among
various organization(charity) all over the World. This we could not
do beforehe met his untimely death. This company will be folding up
in the next one year andhe was the sole signatory of the company
account, which to my knowledge has a closingbalance of US$30.5
Million (Thirty point Five million united States Dollars) As hedid
not leave any "WILL" behind the management of his bank has
writtenseries of letters to me as his (Dr Dirk Vulysteke) confidant
requesting to know whatnext is to be done.


 I'm under pressure from his banker's, that is why I'm soliciting for
your assistanceso that you could help me to facilitate the removal of
this fund. If we do not actfast the bank reserved the right to
declare the fund    "UNCLAIMABLE".And in most cases such fund would
subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for thepurchase of arms and
Ammunition, which will further enhance the course of war inAfrica and
the world in general.

In order to avert this negative development, I seek for your
permission to have youstand as late Dr Dirk Vulysteke next of kin so
that the fund, US$30.5M.would be subsequentlytransferred and paid
into your bank account as the beneficiary's next of kin. Alldocuments
and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out
andI'm assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be
30% of the totalamount. 10% has been set aside for expenses while 60%
shall be for me, this willeventually be invested in your country.

If this proposal is OK by you and you do wish to take advantage of
the trust i hopeto bestow on you, then kindly get immediately to me
via e-mail furnishing me withyour most confidential telephone, fax
number so that I can contact you and make availablerelevant details
of this transaction.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.

Regards,


MR ABAYODE COLE
DIRK OIL & GAS

FROM :INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA.  OUAGADOUGOU 
BURKINA-FASO.

Dear friend,
                                                     
                      TOP SECRET 

  I am Ronald Paul, the director in charge of auditing
and
accounting section of International Bank Of
Africa(IBA) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa with
due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you
on a business transaction that will be very beneficial
to both of us at the end of the transaction . 
During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on October
31st 1999 in a plane crash and the fund has been
dormant in his account with this Bank without any
claim of the fund in our custody either from his
family or relation before our discovery to
thisdevelopment. 
The said amount was U.S $7.2M (seven million two
hundred United States dollars). As it may interest you
to know, I got your impressive information through the
Burkina-faso chamber of commerce on foreign business
relations here in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso.  
Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a
foreign account has been put in place and directives
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to
assist us and also benefit your self to this
greatbusiness opportunity. 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant(A
Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my
side during the time of transfer because I work in
this bank. This is the actual reason why it will
require a second party or fellow who will forward
claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of
oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account
where he will need the money to be re-transferred into
on his request as it may be after due verification and
clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank
where the whole money will be remitted from to your
own designation bank account. 
I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is
100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total
sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer and also telephone bills, while 65% will
be for me and my partners. Please, you have been
adviced to keep "top secret" as I am still in service
and intend to retire from service after we
concludethis deal with you. 
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this
bank until you confirm the money in your account and
ask me to come down to your country for subsequent
sharing of the fund according to percentages
previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary vital information will be sent
to you when I hear from you. I look forward to receive
your email through this
emailaddress:<ronpau@go.com>

Yours faithfully, 
Mr.  Ronald Paul.

Dear Friend,

I am Mustapha Abacha, the second surviving son of the late General Sani
Abacha. We hereby acknowledge the reciept of your mail to my mother 
with thanks,May Allah reward you greatly for your decision to assist us in
this mutually beneficial transaction,My mother has insisted that I deal
with you directly at this crucial stage in this issue rather than the
family lawyer .As my mother has   rightly informed you, we are 
seriously in distress as all our saved money abroad totalling over Us$700M  has
been confisticated by the Nigerian government. If you have been 
following my family's profile in the news lately, you would have read all this
things up.

I wish to inform you at this time that my mother will be reaching you
based on the fact that she would really want to establish a 
relationship based on mutual trust and understanding.We have been dissapointed by
so many people both home and abroad, even people who benefitted from
my fathers regime have all bitten the finger that once fed them, that
is why we had to throw caution to the wind and trust you a stranger who
we had never met all our lives.

Dear Friend, as much as we recognise that a lot of wonders happen these
days,you do not have to doubt the authenticity of my mothers mail to
you, because we are really opperessed, and we need the assistance of
a God fearing person and a good nutured man like you to help us clear
our funds from a security company in London, and bank it up for us 
while we make arrangements to travel and join you up once the survellance on
us is reduced.

For security purposes, I shall be co-ordinating the business 
transaction as tight security is presently placed on my mother, we cannot afford
to lose the only remaining US$40.3Million of all my father left for us.
 At the momment, the funds are in a security company in London and they
were deposited as African  ArtWorks in some luggages. As soon as we are
sure that we can trust you, we shall go ahead to send you the 
Certificate of deposit and the luggage numbers  and  security code numbers. For the
purpose of security and confidentiality, I would require that  you and
i proceed with this business with telephone and fax communication , as
I would not want to discuss this transaction on the internet for 
security
reasons .

So I would suggest that we conduct this business through telephone and
fax communication, while my mother will be reaching you via e-mail as
her telephone line is bugged by security agents.  
As, as soon as I hear from you through my telephone numbers and email
address as above, I shall furnish you with the whole details of how to
finalise the transaction and other information you  might require or
other things you might need to know and also you should be rest assured
that this transaction is 100%risk free and success guaranteed.There are
documents backing the legitimatecy of this transaction that will 
convince your bank or any other bank that might doubt the authenticity of this
funds.   

Also I will send you more information and other information you might
require via fax immediately I hear from you on my telephone. I look 
foward to your urgent response, as my mother and the rest of the immediate 
family geniunely need your help.

Truly Yours, 

Mallam Mustapha Abacha.

ATTN: NEWBY, GREG             

My name Abdul Hakeem,son of Chief Dauda Hakeem Salim. I'm 26yrs old and a student.Please I would like you to assist me urgently before they kill me.
My father is a wealthy cocoa merchant.Trouble began
early last year when my father's associates began
suspecting that my father is not giving proper
account of all the tons of cocoa being cultivated by
local farmers in some villages .
This mistrust deepened between sept, 2000 when they
discovered a very big amount of money that my father
deposited with a security company here in Cotonou Republic Of Benin.

As a result of this discovery and the enviness of the
money ,he was poisioned by his associates.
At his hospital bed ,he revealed to me where to
get the documents of the said deposit and that he
made me the next of kin, being the only child.
He also advised me that in case he dies ,that I should
not stay in this country because his associates will
equally kill me.

My mother died five years ago of breast cancer. 
He directed me that if he dies,I should look
for a foreign partner who will help me to transfer the
money into the person's account and the person will
help me to invest the money in that country.
My father finally died on 5th of june. 
Since then I have been out of school and gone into
hiding for fear of my father's associates. 
All the documents of the $25 million Usd eqivallent of
the amount are with me now.

I will give you 25% of this money ,if you can help me
to transfer this money into your account for onward
investment in your country and 5% will be for any miscelenous expenses that may occour during the transaction.
Please contact me immediately with my E mail address
or telephone number and include your telephone number
and your Fax number to enable me send you all
necessary documents as regards the money before they
kill me.

I'm waiting for your urgent reply.

yours sincerely,

Abdul Hakeem

FROM THE DESK OF: ENGR. ERIC AKPO
LAGOS - NIGERIA.

Dear friend,
 URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Let me start by introducing myself properly  to you. I am Engr.ERIC AKPO, 
a Director General in the Nigerian National  Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 
and I presently head a seven man tenders  board in charge of Contract Awards 
and Payment Approvals. I and my colleagues  are Top Officials of the Federal 
Government Contract Review and Award Panel.  Our duties include  Evaluation,  
Vetting, Approval for payment of Contract  jobs done for the N.N.P.C e.t.c. 
In order to commence this business we  solicit for your assistance to enable 
us transfer into your Account the said  funds.

The source of this funds is as follows: In  the first quarter of 2001 this 
committee was mandated to review and award  contracts to the tune of US$400 
million US dollars to a group of five firms  for the supply
, construction and installation of Oil Pipe  lines in Warri and Port Harcourt. 
During this process my colleagues and I  decided and agreed among ourselves 
to deliberately over-inflate the total  contract sum from US$400 million 
to US$428 million United States dollars  with the main intention of  sharing 
the remaining  sum of US$28 miilion amongst  ourselves.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has since  last year approved the sum of 
US$428 million for us as the contract sum,  and the sum of US$400 million 
has also been paid to the foreign companies  concerned as contract  entitlements 
for the various contracts done, but since  the companies are entiltled to 
US$400 million dollars only, we are now  left with US$28 million dollars 
balance in the account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves, but 
by virtue of our positions as civil  servants and members of  this panel, 
we cannot do this by ourselves, as  we are  prohibited by the Code of Conduct 
Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening  and/or operating foreign accounts 
in our names while still in Government  service, making it impossible for 
us to acquire the money in our  names right  now. 

My Colleagues and I have 
agreed that if you or your company can act  as the beneficiary of  this funds 
on our behalf, you or your Company will  retain 20% of the total amount (US$28 
million), while 60% will be for us  (OFFICIALS) and the remaining 20% will 
be used in offsetting all debts/expenses  and Taxes incurred both local and 
foreign in the cause of this transfer.  Needless to say, the trust reposed 
on you at this juncture is enormous. In  return we demand your complete honesty 
and trust. You must however NOTE that this  transaction will be strictly 
based on the following terms and conditions  as we have stated below;

a) Our conviction of your transparent  honesty and diligence
b) That you would treat this transaction  with utmost secrecy and confidentiality
c) That you will not ask for more share or  try to sit on the funds once 
it is under your custody, or any form of   blackmail.
c) That upon receipt of the funds you will  release the funds as instructed 
by us after you have removed your share of  20% from the total  amount.

Please, note that this transaction is 100%  legal and risk free and we hope 
to conclude this transaction seven bank  working days from the date of receipt 
of the necessary requirements from you . We  are looking forward to doing 
business with you and solicit your Total  Confidentiality in this transaction. 
There is no cause for alarm. I give you my  word that you are completely 
safe in doing business with us.  Transactions like this have been  successfully 
carried out in the past by most Government  executives. Here in my country 
there is great economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption 
is rampant and the order of the day, thus  explaining why you might have 
heard stories of how money is been taken  out of Nigeria, this is because 
everyone is making desperate attempts to  secure his or her future, so that 
when we retire from active service we donot  languish in poverty. I will 
explain more to you when I have heard from  you.

I will bring you into the complete picture  of this pending business transaction 
when I have heard from you and also receive  your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to  enable me fax to you all necessary 
information you need to know about our  pending business transaction. I will 
also send to you my private telephone and  fax numbers where you can always 
reach me.

Your urgent response will be highly  appreciated to enable us transfer the 
funds under this quarter of the year 2002.

Thank you and God Bless.

Yours faithfully,

Engr.ERIC AKPO

COMPLETELY FREE  FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY  LAUNDERING.

MAIL FORWARDED TO GUTNBERG MAILING LIST OWNER

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr, Joseph Edward a native of Cape Town in
South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with
the South Africa  DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY 

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this
magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this
medium. 

I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources
where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S.
Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a
foreign company/individual to receive the said fund
on
our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account
to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in
the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the
total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual
contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,leaving the balance in the Tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100%
safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my
confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately my
e-mail address  whether or not you are
interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,


JOSEPH EDWARD

GREETINGS!!

I come to you with a sincere heart believing in Almighty
Allah that you will consider my plight and come to help and
also benefit from me.
I am Mrs. Amina Mohammed, cousin and personal assistant to
former head of state. Late General Sanni Abacha who died on
the 8th of July 1998 while in power. Before I proceed
please accept my apology for the embarrassment this mail
might cause you for coming from a total stranger whom you
do not know.

Actually, I got your contact from the internet: please do
not feel bad about it because I am compelled to reach you
due to urgent need to safeguard the money in question. Once
again forgive me and come to my aid. Please read the
following carefully.

Sometime in early 1997,my boss late Gen sanni Abacha
entrusted to me the sum of US$20.5m in cash {twenty
million. five hundred thousand US Dollars} due to the trust
and confidence he had on me. This money was meant for
campaign in his self-succession bid but unfortunately he
suddenly died before actualization of his aspiration. This
amount of $20.5m in CASH was deposited with a security
company, which I will disclose in subsequent mail in a
giant trunk box as diplomatic consignment in agreement with
Mr. Mohammed Abacha the heir to the money.

I write to solicit your assistance for the money to be
transferred to your custody. Note that Mr. Mohammed Abacha
is currently in detention
 by the present government for reasons linked to activities
of his father when he was in power. Now based on the
business trust I have on you, I would want you to come
forward and receive this consignment containing the money
in cash on our behalf from the security company for
subsequent disbursement between you and us.

Understand that we are soliciting your assistance because
the present Nigeria government is seizing/freezing any bank
account or valuables belonging to the late Head of state
family and relative. In fact we do not have enough money
now to sustain our family so, I will appreciate if you can
consider our plight and assist us.

 For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you with
20% of the total sum {US$20.5 Million} while the remaining
80% is for us. We hope to invest part of our share in your
country on viable areas of investment as you may advice us.

If you are interested, you will need to visit the security
company for clearance. I assure you that the transaction is
100% risk-free. Please I implore you to keep this
transaction absolutely secret against negative exposure. I
would want you to contact me immediately so that we can
have more confidential correspondence.

Best regards,
Amina M.Abacha
On behalf of Mrs.Mariam Abacha/Family

MR. aja sand 
3/5 RIDER HAGGARD
CLOSE, JO, BORG
SOUTH AFRICA.
Tel:874 - 762864167
Fax:874 - 762864168  
 
          (URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)
 
  (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS   
 
Dear sir,
 
We want to transfer to overseas account
($ 126,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and six two million
United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in Africa, I
want to ask you to  quietly  look for a reliable and
honest person who will be capable  and fit to provide
either an existing bank account  or  to set up a new 
Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an
empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as
you will remain honest to me till the end for this
important business trusting in  you and believing  in
God that you  will never let me down either now or in
future.
 
 I am aja sand,the Auditor General of one of the prime
 banks here South Africa, during the course of our
auditing,I discovered a floating fund  in an account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has
operated on this account again, after going through
some old files in the records I discovered that the
owner of the account died without a [heir]  hence  the
money is floating and  if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The
owner of this account is  Mr.  Allan P.Seaman, a
foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he died,  since
1993. and  no other person knows about this account or
any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Allan P. Seaman   until his death was the manager
 Diamond Safari  [pty]. SA.  
 
We will start the  first transfer with twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest
amount to your account. 

The amount involved is (USD 126 M) One hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is
in US dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Allan P. Seaman is a foreigner too,and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c. 
 
However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind
us together. I got your contact address  from the
Girl who operates my computer,  I am revealing this to
you with believe in God that you will never let me
down
in this business,  you are the first and the only
person that I am contacting for this business, so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number including the full details of
the account to be used for the deposit.
 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any
account of  your choice where the fund will be safe.
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing
and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine, Because the management is ready to approve
this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are  capable  and will meet up with
instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never,  never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will  destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the
money going into the  account. I will apply for annual
leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you
are ready to act and receive this fund in your
account. I will use my position and influence to
obtain all legal approvals for  onward transfer of
this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while
5% will be for expenses both parties might have
incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
email address.     
 
Yours truly
aja sand

ATTN: Manager

HELLO Sir,

I am well confidence of your capability to assist me
in
a transaction for mutual benefit for both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish on you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars cash). This money was made from the
sell of
Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of C=F4te d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from C=F4te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another nearby country where taxation will not
take great toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
the investment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
will be invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this
business. The security of this business is very
important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential.

I shall expect your urgent reply.

My telephone number is 22507625348.

Thank you and God bless you
BELLO SANKOH Tel :22507625348

Dear meester,

 CONFIDENTIAL

 I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, the widow of late Gen. Sanni
Abacha former Nigerian Military head of state who died
mysteriously in June 1998 as a result of cardiac
arrest. Since his death, my family has been going 
through immense harassment including undue police
restriction and molestation. The family bank account
here and abroad has been frozen by the Federal
Government for reasons that are rather vindictive. Our

plight ever made worse by the confiscation/seizure of
our family landed properties and investments here in
Kano,Nigeria and those known abroad. One of the
witch-hunting search light of the government 
bead on our account as a Swiss Bank which had a sum of
US$700M in it and another 450M pounds sterling in a
London account threats of freezing and clamp on the
account have been too much.It is for this reason that
Ideceied to move the sum of US$20.5m dollars through
my family lawyer/Attorney into a financial security
company. 

This money was part of the kickbacks given to my late
husband by his Arab friends for oil License that he
generously gave them while in office.After going
through your profile not minding the onsequences but
hoping that you would understand my predicament and
need your consideration, I humbly appeal to you on
behalf of the entire family to safe us from tarvation,
poverty and strangulation by assisting us to move the
money from it's location into your country where it
shall be safe, since I cannot leave the country now
due to the traveling ban and movement restriction
placed on me and the family. I seek your assistance to
clear it for investment partnership advice. 

I need your cooperation and understanding, please. You
can reach us through the family lawyer Barrister Bello
Musa (SAN) He shall brief you further for the
effective and logical movement of the money. You
can equally get in touch with him preferably via his
email address: hassan_bello@talk21.com. 

Please, furnish my lawyer with your Fax, Telephone and
Mobile numbers for an easier communication.For your
anticipated corporation, I and the family, the lawyer
have agreed to give you 20% of the money for your
assistance while 75% shall be held in trust for us
until we arrive in your country and decide on a joint
business venture to do with the money as soon as all
traveling bans are lifted and freedom regained, while
5% has been mapped out for any incidental expenses
that may arise. Treat with confidant I plead, and do
reply to safe us from the stifling grip of this
merciless government. 

Best regards,
 MARYAM ABACHA (MRS.)

GREETINGS!!

I come to you with a sincere heart believing in Almighty
Allah that you will consider my plight and come to help and
also benefit from me.
I am Mr. Ahmed Mohammed, cousin and personal assistant to
former head of state. Late General Sanni Abacha who died on
the 8th of July 1998 while in power. Before I proceed
please accept my apology for the embarrassment this mail
might cause you for coming from a total stranger whom you
do not know.

Actually, I got your contact from the internet: please do
not feel bad about it because I am compelled to reach you
due to urgent need to safeguard the money in question. Once
again forgive me and come to my aid. Please read the
following carefully.

Sometime in early 1997,my boss late Gen sanni Abacha
entrusted to me the sum of US$20.5m in cash {twenty
million. five hundred thousand US Dollars} due to the trust
and confidence he had on me. This money was meant for
campaign in his self-succession bid but unfortunately he
suddenly died before actualization of his aspiration. This
amount of $20.5m in CASH was deposited with a security
company, which I will disclose in subsequent mail in a
giant trunk box as diplomatic consignment in agreement with
Mr. Mohammed Abacha the heir to the money.

I write to solicit your assistance for the money to be
transferred to your custody. Note that Mr. Mohammed Abacha
is currently in detention
 by the present government for reasons linked to activities
of his father when he was in power. Now based on the
business trust I have on you, I would want you to come
forward and receive this consignment containing the money
in cash on our behalf from the security company for
subsequent disbursement between you and us.

Understand that we are soliciting your assistance because
the present Nigeria government is seizing/freezing any bank
account or valuables belonging to the late Head of state
family and relative. In fact we do not have enough money
now to sustain our family so, I will appreciate if you can
consider our plight and assist us.

 For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you with
20% of the total sum {US$20.5 Million} while the remaining
80% is for us. We hope to invest part of our share in your
country on viable areas of investment as you may advice us.

If you are interested, you will need to visit the security
company for clearance. I assure you that the transaction is
100% risk-free. Please I implore you to keep this
transaction absolutely secret against negative exposure. I
would want you to contact me immediately so that we can
have more confidential correspondence.

Best regards,
Ahmed M.Abacha
On behalf of Mrs.Mariam Abacha/Family

Attn: The President/Managing Director I am dr serpee, Manager of Bills/Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department of FIRST AFRICAN FINANCE Ltd in South Africa. In my department, there is an abandoned sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars Only (US$12,000,000.00) in an account of one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family on November, 1996 in a ghastly plane crash. Since we got information on his death, we have been expecting any of his Next-of-Kin to come forward and claim his money. Unfortunately, nobody has come forward to claim this money. The South African banking law and guidelines here stipulate that any account abandoned or dormant for a period of years is deemed closed and all money contained therein would be forfeited to the Government treasury account. Now it is being speculated that the above sum will be transferred into the government account as an unclaimed fund on or before the end of 2002. And we do not want the money to go into the government account as unclaimed bill. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you, hence my contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the Next-of-Kin to the deceased, so that we can release the fund into your account for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it. Also, one of the reasons for our requesting you to present yourself as the Next-of-Kin is occasioned by the fact that the deceased (customer) was a foreigner. The mode of sharing, after a successful transfer of the money into your account would be: 65% to my colleagues and I; 30% will go to you, and 5% is set aside to off-set all the expenses we would incur at the course of this business. If you are interested in this deal, you are therefore urged to respond immediately either by e-mail: (DRSERPEE@yahoo.com) or my personal/confidential Telephone: 1227-73-2562534 or Fax number: 34-027-73-2618440 to enable me intimate you with the detail information on the modalities. Please treat this business proposal as strictly confidential for security reasons. Kind Personal Regards, DR.SERPEE MphanaJohannesburg, South Africa.

Dear  Sir.

I am Mustapha Abacha, the second surviving son of the late General
Sani Abacha. We hereby acknowledge the reciept of your mail to my
mother	with thanks,May Allah reward you greatly for your decision to
assist us in this mutually beneficial transaction,My mother has
insisted that I deal with you directly at this crucial stage in this
issue rather than the family lawyer .As my mother has rightly
informed you, we are seriously in distress as all our saved money
abroad totalling over Us$700M  has been confisticated by the Nigerian
government. If you have been  following my family's profile in the
news lately, you would have read all this things up.

I wish to inform you at this time that my mother will be reaching you
based on the fact that she would really want to establish a
relationship based on mutual trust and understanding.We have been
dissapointed by so many people both home and abroad, even people who
benefitted from my fathers regime have all bitten the finger that
once fed them, that is why we had to throw caution to the wind and
trust you a stranger who we had never met all our lives.

Dear Friend, as much as we recognise that a lot of wonders happen
these days,you do not have to doubt the authenticity of my mothers
mail to you, because we are really opperessed, and we need the
assistance of a God fearing person and a good nutured man like you to help us clear
our funds from a security company in London, and bank it up for us
while we make arrangements to travel and join you up once the
survellance on us is reduced.

For security purposes, I shall be co-ordinating the business
transaction as tight security is presently placed on my mother, we
cannot afford to lose the only remaining US$40.3Million of all my
father left for us.  At the momment, the funds are in a security
company in London and they were deposited as African  ArtWorks in
some luggages. As soon as we are sure that we can trust you, we shall
go ahead to send you the  Certificate of deposit and the luggage
numbers  and  security code numbers. For the purpose of security and
confidentiality, I would require that  you and i proceed with this
business with telephone and fax communication , as I would not want
to discuss this transaction on the internet for security reasons .

So I would suggest that we conduct this business through telephone and
fax communication, while my mother will be reaching you via e-mail as
her telephone line is bugged by security agents.
As, as soon as I hear from you through my telephone numbers and email
address as above, I shall furnish you with the whole details of how to
finalise the transaction and other information you  might require or
other things you might need to know and also you should be rest
assured that this transaction is 100%risk free and success
guaranteed.There are documents backing the legitimatecy of this
transaction that will convince your bank or any other bank that might
doubt the authenticity of this funds.

Also I will send you more information and other information you might
require via fax immediately I hear from you on my telephone. I look
foward to your urgent response, as my mother and the rest of the
immediate family geniunely need your help.

Truly Yours,

Mallam Mustapha Abacha

Dear  Sir.

I am Mustapha Abacha, the second surviving son of the late General
Sani Abacha. We hereby acknowledge the reciept of your mail to my
mother	with thanks,May Allah reward you greatly for your decision to
assist us in this mutually beneficial transaction,My mother has
insisted that I deal with you directly at this crucial stage in this
issue rather than the family lawyer .As my mother has rightly
informed you, we are seriously in distress as all our saved money
abroad totalling over Us$700M  has been confisticated by the Nigerian
government. If you have been  following my family's profile in the
news lately, you would have read all this things up.

I wish to inform you at this time that my mother will be reaching you
based on the fact that she would really want to establish a
relationship based on mutual trust and understanding.We have been
dissapointed by so many people both home and abroad, even people who
benefitted from my fathers regime have all bitten the finger that
once fed them, that is why we had to throw caution to the wind and
trust you a stranger who we had never met all our lives.

Dear Friend, as much as we recognise that a lot of wonders happen
these days,you do not have to doubt the authenticity of my mothers
mail to you, because we are really opperessed, and we need the
assistance of a God fearing person and a good nutured man like you to help us clear
our funds from a security company in London, and bank it up for us
while we make arrangements to travel and join you up once the
survellance on us is reduced.

For security purposes, I shall be co-ordinating the business
transaction as tight security is presently placed on my mother, we
cannot afford to lose the only remaining US$40.3Million of all my
father left for us.  At the momment, the funds are in a security
company in London and they were deposited as African  ArtWorks in
some luggages. As soon as we are sure that we can trust you, we shall
go ahead to send you the  Certificate of deposit and the luggage
numbers  and  security code numbers. For the purpose of security and
confidentiality, I would require that  you and i proceed with this
business with telephone and fax communication , as I would not want
to discuss this transaction on the internet for security reasons .

So I would suggest that we conduct this business through telephone and
fax communication, while my mother will be reaching you via e-mail as
her telephone line is bugged by security agents.
As, as soon as I hear from you through my telephone numbers and email
address as above, I shall furnish you with the whole details of how to
finalise the transaction and other information you  might require or
other things you might need to know and also you should be rest
assured that this transaction is 100%risk free and success
guaranteed.There are documents backing the legitimatecy of this
transaction that will convince your bank or any other bank that might
doubt the authenticity of this funds.

Also I will send you more information and other information you might
require via fax immediately I hear from you on my telephone. I look
foward to your urgent response, as my mother and the rest of the
immediate family geniunely need your help.

Truly Yours,

Mallam Mustapha Abacha

Hello,
I know this will come to you as a surprise, receiving an email from someone like me since you don't know me personally.
Kindly allow me; I am Smith Moyo, son of Dr. Morgan Moyo, who was murdered in February last year in the land dispute crisis in Zimbabwe.

My family used to live in a town called Chinhoyi located in the heart of Mashonaland about 120km from Harare, the capital city of my former country Zimbabwe, Chinhoyi was largely a peaceful farming area where one can own land and cultivate it if one worked hard enough. The relative peace existing in Chinhoyi
and our lives were shattered with the beginning of the ruling party's sponsored land invasion by war veterans who we suspected were acting with the backing of the government of Mugabe. My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of President Robert Mugabe. For his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition Party. Before his death, My Father on one of his many trips abroad took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$17.5 Million (Seventeen Million, Five-Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a security and finance company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.

The money was deposited with the security company on our arrival in Johannesburg to avoid its seizure and largely for it's safety too. President Mugabe gave this money to my father for investment purpose while they were still in good terms. This land problem arose when President Mugabe who according to my late father, in a desperate bid to hold on to power for life introduced a new land act, which wholly affected the rich farmers who were mostly white and some blacks eventually vehemently condemned the method adopted by the government. And that resulted in rampant killings, lootings and wide scale mob actions by the veterans and some political thugs. Precisely, more than 31 (Thirty-One) people have been killed and as I write to you now, at least 40 white and black families have fled rising violence on their farms in north-western Zimbabwe and about 300 family members had fled by Sunday from about 100 raided farms. Some were flown out on light aircraft to the Kariba airport aft!
!
er mobs blocked several roads.

It is against this background that my family and I currently staying in South Africa as asylum seekers, have decided to transfer my father's money into a foreign account.

As the eldest son of my late father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking an honest individual with vast experience in business to help us safeguard and invest this money. I am presently living in South Africa, as an asylum seeker and financial law of the Republic of South Africa do not allow asylum seekers
certain financial rights. In view of this, coupled with the way this money was acquired, I decided to invest this money anywhere else inside or outside Africa, but preferably outside Africa.

>From the above you will understand that my entire life and my family depends on this money, as such I shall be very grateful if you can assist me to transfer this money out of South Africa to your company or personal account in your name, in any of the commercial banks.

Please note that by your offering to assist us we will on your contacting me over the phone discuss a suitable compensation for you and also I would like to mention too that this transaction has no risks involved from your end whatsoever and another major thing I demand from you is an honest answer if you have handled any transaction of this kind of magnitude before and assurance from you that our family has your complete trust and assurance that this money will be safe once transferred to your account.
Please I can be reached on my telephone number +27 83 581 5744 to further clarify any other question you may want to ask me. You can also contact me by fax on +27 83 333 7811.

On proving your honesty we will then forward you the lodging documents for our late father's deposit to prove our claim to you and also for confirmation.
I and my Mother live a very quiet life here in South Africa trying to forget the recent horrors that we escaped so I please demand that you keep the existence of our late father's money discreetly for reasons bordering on the safety of myself and my family members shall be very grateful if you maintain the confidentiality of our request to you for assistance.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours in hope,

Smith Moyo.

Warm Greetings from Argentina

Let me introduce myself to you: I am Engineer Alejandro Vega from Argentina, Representative of STARLAB Portable Planetarium to African,  South American and Caribe (based out of Somerville, Massachusetts, U.S.A. please see http://www.planetarios.com).

I plan to introduce in Africa countries the first STARLAB Portable Planetarium because I know  the STARLAB is not well known in Africa and It is a worthwhile educational and cultural tool that would be useful for any Company or National Agency. 

STARLAB is a very exciting and wonderful educational  tool used in schools, museums and amusement parks. STARLAB has been met with great success throughout Latin America and has proven to be an excellent educational tool as well as a great business tool. The STARLAB system is a portable teaching environment that can be brought right into the classroom. It consists of an inflatable dome, a projector, projection cylinders, and optional accessories. It can be used in schools, museums, amusement parks, clubs, camps, etc.

Easy to store and transport, the system packs down into traveling cases and a duffel bag. In fact, the STARLAB system is so compact that it can be handled by one person and transported in the back of most small cars. Once unpacked, STARLAB can be set up in under ten minutes. 

STARLAB is a multicultural, multidisciplinary tool for education. In combination with the excellent curriculum materials available from Learning Technologies, its uses are as limitless as the universe itself. 

Some of the topics taught using the STARLAB system: Sciences: astronomy, earth science, life science, physical science, geology, geography, cellular biology, oceanography, weather patterns, navigation. The Arts: art, literature, mythology. The Projection Cylinders are the secret to the versatility of STARLAB. These interchangeable, computer-generated mylar cylinders fit over a projection lamp to create vivid images on the inside of the dome. They make it easy to demonstrate the night sky, the inside of a biological cell, a global projection of the earth or colorful mythological characters. 

I think that STARLAB would be a very interesting and excellent contribution to your educational and cultural programs. And it is a very good profit business for companies devoted to give Schools Services, Events and Promotion and Amusement Parks.

Please let me know if you have any questions, suggestions or ideas. I would be more than happy to help. Also I would very happy if you send me a feedback.


PS: I will send you a Power Point Presentation about STARLAB if you wish it that l which I hope will help further your understanding as well.

Warm Regards from Argentina.

WEMA BANK PLC. 
LAGOS/NIGERIA 

Dear Sir, 

REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP 

Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. 

Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains
unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money. However, with my being in direct charge of
Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late
Dr.David Fang' on private business deal basis. 

Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- 

(a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang 

(b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax 
number for details on how to proceed. 

For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. 

Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship. 

Regards,
Frank William

However a new elected president Mr J.A. Kufuor has
taken over the mantel of leadership of our country and
has sworn to bring to book all corrupt officials who
enriched themselves during the past regimes. I then
decided to leave the country with all I have down to
Lome Togo before he would appoint
his probe panel. The above sum was moved to a finance
and security company here in Togo for safe keeping
pending when I will get a partner who will
assist me in moving this fund out of Togo for an
investment. For your
assistance I promise to offer you 20 % of the total
amount involved.

My dear though I do not know you very well it might
interest you to note
that I got your contact in an international yellow
page and believe that you will be capable to
accommodate this fund and assist me to invest in
agriculture  and Real Estate Development.
If you are interested and ready to assist me in this
regard, kindly get in touch with me to enable me
proceed immediately to the security company
and pay of the demurrage.

NB. The relevant documents that covers the fund
deposited in a finance company will sand to you on
request.
Thanks

Kufour Ibrahim

FROM THE DESK OF 
MR.GABRIEL OFFOR
LAGOS, NIGERIA.
TEL:234-80-33150159
FAX:234-1-4400330 
   
Attn: The Managing Director/Ceo
   
Dear Sir,
   
TRANSFER OF US$40 MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AND
SUBSEQUENT SHARING WITH YOU.

I, Mr.Gabriel Offor an Accountant and a member of
Contract Award Committee with Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
  
I got to know you and your address from our Chamber
Of Commerce and Industry directory and subsequently
wish to involve you in business to transfer money
into your bank account for our mutual benefits and the above money is now in the Central Bank of Nigeri(CBN)suspense account waiting for claim.
  
How we got this money (The Business): We are three
officials of the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation, who are in charge of Contract. In 2000
we awarded a contract to foreign contractor:
Snamprogetti Incorporation. For the Supply of
Petrochemical and Pipeline Equipment, 270,000 BPSD Polypropylene and Installation of 500,000, Monax Axial Flow Turbine for Port Harcourt Oil Refinery.
  
We inflated the cost of this contract, and by so
doing, we got a value of US$40 Million. We have
alsosuccessfully documented this amount under the
contract Number FGN/NNPC/02299C.B/2000. The project
has been commissioned and approved by the Federal Government and the Original Contractor have received their work value.
  
I and my officials in the said corporation (NNPC)
Have coherently agreed with the officials of the
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to remit this over inflated money into any reliable individual or company's account overseas, who has to pose and confidently obtain the money on our behalf. We need an honest and trusted person or company, whose account we can remit this amount totaling US$40 Million. To
achieve this, we need your banking particulars for the immediate remittance of this money into your account such as:
  
   1) The name of your bank and address
   2) Your account number and beneficiary name
   3) The phone and fax numbers of your bank
   4) Your full company name and address
   5) Your private Phone and fax numbers
   
Other contractors have claimed their own money. As
You should know this is a deal, we cannot come
openly to claim this money directly. And moreover we as civil servants cannot take up contracts nor operate
foreign accounts. This is why we write you to
assist us to remit this money into your account after which we shall meet to share the money with you. Let truth and honest be our watchword towards this deal, your personality and interest is well protected. For
your assistance we have agreed to give you 25% of the
total sum to be remitted and 75% will be for us.
Keep this deal highly confidential until this money is
finally transferred into your account.
   
We look forward to receiving your positive reply
through my phone/fax number 234-80-33150159,234-1-4400330 or by email address immediately.

While waiting your anticipated co-operation.
  
Best regards,
  
MR.GABRIEL OFFOR.

dear Dr. Gregory,
 My mother ask me to look for a reliable foreign 
partner I got your contact in cause of a serious 
search in the internet for a reliable foreign partner.
  I'm Sammy Abubaka the son of a late sierraleonian  
businessman, late Mr John Abubaka the owner of  (RMS)
mining company in Sierraleone .Who died two  years ago
when the revolutionary united front rebels
(R.U.F)attacked our residence  in Makeni Sierraleone. 
 Following the cease fire agreement which was reach  
with the help of United Nation peace keeping troops,I
used the oppoturnity to leave the  country with a very
important document of (US$15.000.000m)fifteen million
U.S Dollars  deposited   by my late father in security
company in Dakar  Senegal under my name.this money was
realised from  diamond export, now i and my mother are
seeking  asylum  in Dakar - Senegal under(UNHCR).   My
main reason of contacting you is that I received  a  
call from the Security Company warning that I  should 
make haste to dislodge the money or I loose it to high
dumurrage rate which has pilled up since 1997  up 
till date. They advised I should present an 
organisation/company as the beneficiary of the  amount
 as the money cannot be released to me as a client 
considering my status here as a refugee. I only  want 
this done this way because your country is 
politically   suitable for any profitable investment,
which will emphasize the uniquines  of the
transfer.However I contact you based on your
capability and vast knowledge on international 
commercial investment. My aim of contacting you is to
assist me in two ways:
(1) To help me transfer the money to your country.
(2)  to help  me get a profitable business to invest
the fund based on your professional advise.For your
assistance and  co-operation we will give you 15%of
the total sum  realised after the sucessfull transfer
of this  money.  Please kindly communicate your
acceptance of this  proposal so that we can discuss
the modalities of  seeing this transaction through.we
count on you greatly for your assistance  Awaiting to 
to hear from you soon.  

Sammy Abubaka.

Dearest 

I am DANIEL NGOBE,I came to know of you in my search for a reliable  
and reputable foreign partner to handle a transaction which involves a
huge amount in United States Dollar.My father was the HEAD of mines and Natural Resources of the Republic of Sierra-Leone,whom the then President Tijan Kabbah force in their struggle to reinstate him back to power was killed.
  During his tenure, he accummulated thirty six million ($36,000,000)
USD.This he kept in a Trunk Box and moved it to an Insurance Security
Deposit Company in Accra - Ghana. Being the next kin,the document regarding these consigments were handed over to me by my father'S lawyer after his death.I have  searched and found the Security Company,where I confirmed that the consignment was deposited for safe keeping in their Security vault.
   Presently my mother and I are refugees in Accra Ghana, and it will be unwise to take such enormous amount myself to the bank due to my present condition. It therefore becomes apparent to move this fund outside Africa to your country for investment purpose. Hence my
contacting you.
  The Company where the consignment is deposited,is not aware of the content of the trunk box as it was declared by my late father as family valuable and Africa Art Piece.It is only you and I, that are aware that the content is money. I am soliciting for your assistance as the sole beneficiary of this fund, to help us claim this consignment, and also help us deposit it in any bank of your choice in your Country.Please this is an inheritance we intend to use properly. we are willing to offer you 20% of this total cash for your support, and 10%of this funds for charity programs, as it might deed fit with your assistance. 

We intend to place This fund under your advice and instruction on how to utilize this money Judiciously. I would also want you to know that this transaction is 100% risk-free.  Please I want this transaction to be treated with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.

Your prompt response will be appreciated.

Yours sincerely,
DANIEL NGOBE

DEAR SIR/MADAM, 

THIS LETTER MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE TO YOU, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE NEVER MET OR DISCUSSED BEFORE. BASICALLY, THE MESSAGE MIGHT SOUND STRANGE, BUT IT IS FACTUAL IN REALITY IF ONLY YOU CARE TO 
KNOW. THE TRUTH IS THAT I SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED YOU FIRST THROUGH A MORE CONFIDENTIAL MEANS EVEN IF IT'S AT LEAST TO RESPECT YOUR INTEGRITY,PLEASE ACCEPT MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES IF I HAD CAUGHT YOU UNAWARE. I FRANKLY DO NOT MEAN ANY HARM IN PASSING MY GOODWILL MESSAGE. 

I AM BEN SULEMAN I WAS ONCE A SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE (NOW DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO)PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO. I GOT YOUR INFORMATION THROUGH THE NETHERLANDS 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. DURING THE MILITARY ONSLAUGHT BY LAUREN KABILA FORCES TO REMOVE THE FORMER PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO.
I WAS INSTRUCTED BY MY BOSS, THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE SEKO TO GO TO THE NETHERLANDS(HOLLAND)WITH HIS DEFENSE ADVISER TO PURCHASE ARMS AND MILITARY HARDWARE WORTH THIRTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
($35,000,000.00 USD) TO FIGHT REBEL LEADER LAURENT KABILA.BUT WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT MOBUTU REGIME WILL FALL AFTER WE HAD LEFT FOR HOLLAND, WE DECIDED TO DIVERT THIS FUND WHICH WAS IN CASH AND DEPOSITED IT IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN HOLLAND FOR SAFE KEEPING. 
WE DID NOT DISCLOSE THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOX BECAUSE IT WAS WELL CONCEALED; WE HAVE MADE SOME PAYMENT TO THE SECURITY COMPANY FOR THE SAFE KEEPING OF THIS BOX. 

NOW, WE FELT THAT THE SECURITY AND SAFETY OF THE SAID FUND IS BEING THREATENED IN HOLLAND FOLLOWING THE NEW FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN THE NETHERLANDS AND DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.BASED ON THIS, WE 
NEED A RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGNER WHO CAN ASSIST US TO MOVE THIS MONEY ABROAD (ANY COUNTRY OUTSIDE HOLLAND) AND HOLD THIS MONEY ON TRUST FOR US UNTIL WE FIND OUR WAY OUT TO MEET HIM THERE. THIS MONEY IS A STATE FUND, AS SUCH IT IS A DEAL BETWEEN 
YOU AND US, IT SHOULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL BETWEEN US BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS. WE HAVE MADE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENT ON HOW WE ARE TO MOVE OUT THIS MONEY AS SOON AS WE GET A TRUSTWORTHY PARTNER ABROAD. 

MOREOVER, KNOWING THE STRICT MONETARY POLICY HERE, IT WILL BE UNWISE TO INVEST HERE COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT OUR PRESENT STATUS AS POLITICAL REFUGEE PUTS LIMIT TO THE EXTENT AND VOLUME OF OUR FINACIAL TRANSACTION. THIS IS THE PRINCIPAL REASON WHY WE NEED YOU TO ASSIST US MOVE OUT THIS MONEY TO YOUR COUNTRY AND INVEST THIS FUND THERE. SITUATION HAS EVEN BECOME BETTER WITH THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT-MR LAURENT
KABILA FEW MONTHS AGO. THIS MEANS THAT THERE WILL BE NO TRACE OF THIS FUND AND THE WHOLE TRANSACTION NOW REMAINS 100% RISK FREE. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE TRANSACTION AND WILLING TO HELP US MOVE OUT THIS MONEY, WE WILL OFFER YOU 25% OF THE TOTAL MONEY, 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR ANY UNFORESEEN EXPENSES, WHILE 70% WILL BE FOR US HERE. PLEASE NOTIFY ME IF THIS PROPOSAL SUITS YOU BY CONTACTING ME BY MY EMAIL FOR FURTHER DETAILS. 

KIND REGARDS, 
BEN SULEMAN

Sir,

                                       STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Alhaji M. K. Ahmad Director, Receivership and Liquidation Department of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC). Decree no. 22 of 1988 established the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation by the Federal Government to insure bank deposits thereby helping to promote safe and sound banking system in Nigeria, protect depositors' interest and further inculcate banking habit among others, to examine the books and affairs of insured banks and other deposit-taking financial institutions.

The NDIC is an independent body and acts as an additional regulatory authority in the supervision of banks to ensure compliance with the regulations aimed at ensuring bank solvency. The examiners of the NDIC will not only assess the bank's condition and verify compliance with bank regulations, they also counsel banks regarding management practice and suggest ways by which banks can reduce the risk of failure and loss to depositors. Ultimately, the corporation has the power to restrict the activities of bank found not to be in compliance with regulations or advise the shutdown of banks that are deemed to be insolvent. 

Recently, Savannah Bank of Nigeria PLC was shutdown for non compliance, insolvency and management practice that were inimical to the interest of the banking sectors in Nigeria and subsequently the bank was liquidated and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) appointed as the Receivership Managers of its Assets and Liabilities. 

For your due consideration, in the process of going through the books at the foreign operations department where domiciliary account are maintained and operated with a view to ascertain how the bank depositors can be paid, I and my colleagues discovered an un-claim amount of US$24.5 million in the account of one of the bank foreign resident customer, also a foreign contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria during the past military regime of late General Sani Abacha who unfortunately died in a ghastly motor accident in 1999. And since then no one came forward as the Beneficiary/Next of Kin to the Deceased customer. From available records in the bank nowhere did we found any information concerning his Next of Kin only that the account was marked "Deceased" with the date and cause of his death. 

Upon this discovery I and the top officials who are aware of the money resolve to make business with you by asking you to present yourself as the next of kin to enable proper documentation to be done for the payment and onward remittance of this money to your account as the Beneficiary/Next of Kin since nobody came for it or discover that he has this money with the bank prior to it liquidation. Note more importantly that as soon as the bank Assets and Liabilities are ascertained and settled, the bank will become history. Hence, we decide to avail ourselves this opportunity.

In exchange for your service, you will receive 25% while 75% for us and 5% for reimbursement of sundry expenses local and foreign incurred by you and us during the cause of this business.

Further, on or before conclusion of the transaction there must be need for a "face to face" meeting to enable us establish full confidence in ourselves and discuss areas of investment opportunities in your Country we will invest part of our own share.

Furthermore, to enable us commence the business without delay we request by return e-mail your direct contact telephone and fax number, full name and address and your designated bank coordinates.

Note that all logistics are perfectly in place for a hitch-free transfer of the above sum to your nominated account within 14 working days from the date of receipt of the above details. It is pertinent to state here that this business demand strict confidentiality

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation as we look forward to your reply.

Yours faithfully,

Alhaji M. K. Ahmed.
For: Colleagues.

FROM MR BEN  KHU,
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF
AFRICA LOME- TOGO.

DEAR SIR,
  I am mr ben khu, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of the Foreign Remittance Department,INTERNATIONAL BANK OF
AFRICA Lome-Togo in westAfrica with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on october
31st 1999 in a plane crash and the fund has been
dormant in his account with this Bank without any
claim of the fund in our custody either from his
family or relation before our discovery to this
development. Although personally, I keep this
information secret within myself and partners to !
enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and
successful during the time of execution. The said
amount was us$18.5M (Eighteen million,five hundred
thousand united states dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through internet directory . It is when i was searching for viable and capable person to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem that i came accross your contact and we decided to contact you after praying to God almighty to give us some one who will shun greed and will not sit on our own share of the money at the conclusion of the
transaction ,so it is on this believe that we
decided to reach you as we believe that you are are
good person.In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this country as i and my colleagues are civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on our side duri!
ng the time of transfer because I work in this bank.
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where
he/she will want the money to be re-transferred into on his/her request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be
remitted from to your own designation bank account. May I at this point emphasize  that this transaction is 100% risk free as we have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of
the total sum as gratification, while 10% will be
set aside to take care of expenses that may arise
during the time of transfer and also telephone
bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners.
Please, you ! have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. TAKE NOTEI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any
country you advice us to investin. All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to
me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal on my confidential number 228 -903 13 66.

Yours faithfully,

MR  BEN KHU

Attention

REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one =

this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of it's swiftness =
and confidentiality.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr Chris =

of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to =
handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a =
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

A foreigner, Late Engineer William Adams, an oil Merchant /contractor =
with the federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago =
in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC,Lagos, =
and had a closing balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million, Two Hundred =
Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably =
expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or =
alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and =
ammunition at a military war collage here in Nigeria.

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in =
touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no =
known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our =
chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that =
an arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE " and then be =
subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which =

general.

In order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my =
trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you =

fund have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk =

Dear Sir ,

I am the Chief Medical Doctor and close confidant of
Mrs. Maryam Abacha, the former first lady and wife of
the late Gen.Sani Abacha, the former head of state and
commander in chief of the armed forces of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria.  She (MRS. M. ABACHA), has as a
result of the trust and confidence, she has in me
mandated that I search for a reliable and trust worthy
foreign partner, who will help receive some funds
which she had in cash totaling US$35M (Thirty Five
Million United States Dollars only) into a personal,
company or any reliable foreign bank accounts within
or outside your country as all their personal and
family Bank accounts within and outside Nigeria have
all been frozen by the Nigerian authorities. (I would
refer you to the website of Weekly Tell magazine: WWW.
TELLMAGAZINE.com of November 23, 1998 page 25,and
another edition of TELL WEEKLY MAGAZINE of October 11
1999, Page 10 captioned the tyrants son, for further
information about this money and the ABACHAS)

This money in question has however, been clearly moved
in defaced form and Deposited with a security company
that has branches in Asia, Africa, Europe and various
parts of America. It may also interest you to note
that she (MRS. ABACHA) and her family have, Since the
inception of the present democratic government, been
placed Under partial house arrest, with their
international traveling passports seized.

However, just last week the international lawyers
representing the family in London were able to secure
an out of court settlement with the family agreeing to
voluntarily release the sum of  $1.6billion to federal
government, so that The first son would be released
and all charges against the family and the murder case
against Muhammed abacha will be dropped by the federal
government. But some enemies of the family are still
bent in dealing with the them by ill advicing the
Obasanjo government not to accept this offer. To this
end the family wants this money US$35M (Thirty Five
Million United States Dollars only) moved to a safe
place immediately for investemnt depending on the
outcome of the negotiation.Note that this transaction
involves no risks what so ever, as you will have no
dealing with my country, Nigeria.

Rather you will deal directly with the Security
Company, which is based where the money is right now.
Let me have your confidential Tel/Fax numbers in your
response to this proposal. I shall let you into a
complete detailed picture of this mutual beneficial
transaction when I have received your anticipated
positive reply.

You can also reply to this e-mailaddress:
drmusa@rediffmail.com

This matter should be treated as urgent and
Confidential!

 commited so many attrocities against humanity, my 
 father, who was a collaborator to the rebels was 
 killed during the war because of his inability to 
 produce over twenty eight million United States 
 dollars (U.S$28.M)given to him by the Revolutionary 
 United front(R.U.F)rebels for the procurement of Arms 
 Armunition. 

 However,truth and evidence has unfolded matters 
 that we saw his death as a sacrifice and restoration 
 of peace in our dear country, but before my father's 
 death during one of our visit to him while in 
 detention, he disclosed to us of an existence of two 
 sealed trunk boxes, which he keep in the underground 
 vault of our villa in Free-Town, which he said 
 contained the sum of Eight million U.S 
 dollars(US $8.000.000.00) 

 We immediately went back home and found the boxes 
 intact, we took to my father's advice and fled out of 
 the country through coastal river, after days of sea 
 travelling with the trunk boxes intact and arrived in 
 Abidjan with the help of Mr. Bruno Tataglia an Italian 
 man who claimed he was assisting me to bring me and my 
 family to Italy and that he is going to guarantee our 
 safety and that he is going to assist us in keeping 
 this fund save. What I see was deffrence to what I was 
 been promised actually Bruno brought me to Italy with 
 this two trunk boxes,with the help of the assistance 
 two thousand courier affliated with Diplomatic service 
 that brought this boxes to Italy in a village called 
 Padover 

 but after two days in an unknow area Mr. BRUNO DO AWAY 
 WITH ONE OF THE TRUNK, 
 AND EACH BOX CONTAIN fOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. 

 what I now left with is only one box and I have to go 
 back to the coureir service deposit this box again as 
 an african Arts that belong to my father business 
 affliate (foreign)kept the deposit cost and move it to 
 the Netherlands for I am not too sure and I am afraid 
 of Mr. Bruno not to come for the remaining box , Sir, 
 this is the only remaining family fortunes   and the 
 security 
 company that took the trunk boxes to Netherland as 
 family valuables, withholding the truth of the real 
 content of the boxes, this I have done for security 
 reason and kept down the deposit cost, even as   
 I am writing to you, the security company is not aware 
 that 
 the boxes contains money, although the war as 
 partially ended even our country is now preparing for 
 another Democratic election 
 but we have considered it save to 
 remain outside the country and not to return back to 
 our country since we have lost our bread winner and 
 all our properties confiscated by the new government 
 of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
 
 I have a limited knowledge in business world, hence 
 the reason for soliciting your assistance to please 
 make a residence arrangement for us me and my younger 
 one in your country 
 and to guide us to invest this remaing money money in 
 your company 
   
 I have the consent of my mother and we have resolve to 
 give you 18% percent of the cash for assisting us in if 
 only you are not going to behave like Mr. BRUNO THE 
 ITALIAN MAN. 

 this transaction, every arrangement to withdraw out 
 the consignment from the security company and make you 
 as the bonifide beneficiary of the said trunk and 
 subsequent movement into your country will guarantee 
 and it's hitch-free and risk-free, I await your 
 response  through the above  or below e-mail address 
 enable me to give you further details.I am curently on 
 political asylum in the Netherlands 
 and have kept low my profile. 
  please your uptmost secrecy is highly needed.

 make known to me so as to solicit help else where. 
 Thanks for your understanding. 

 (for the family)

DEAR FRIEND,
I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. 
Sanni Abacha former Nigeria Military Head of State who
died mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest. 
Since after my husband's death my family is under
restriction of movement and that not withstanding,we
are being molested, policed and our Bank Accounts both
here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian
Civilian Government.  Furthermore, my living eldest
son is in detention by the Nigerian Government for
more interrogation about my husband's assets and
some vital documents following the resent discovery of
my husband's Swiss Bank Account in which the huge sum
of US$700 Million and DM450 Million was logged.  
  I therefore, decided to contact you in confidence
since I have
been able to move out the sum of US$20 Million Dollars
somewhere abroad. All the money are sealed in two metal Boxes for security
reasons.  Due to my experience in the hands of people.
   I have decided to do this with a totally new but
trustworthy person who can keep this matter
confidential.  This is very important to me.  
  
  It is to my consent here that my lawyer and I
decided to personally appeal to you seriously and
religiously for your urgent assistance to move this
money into your country where I believe it will be
safe since I cannot leave the country due to the
restriction of movement imposed on the members of my
family by the Nigerian Government.  You can contact me
through my lawyer's  email address above and he shall
get all document relating to the consignment changed
to
your name before delivery. 
  
  However, arrangements have been put in place to move
this money out of the country in a secret vault
through a security company, and as soon as you
indicate your interest, my lawyer shall send you the
Air-Way Bill of the luggage and other related document
 so that you can help to claim the luggage.
  
Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 25% of the
total sum while 75% is to be held on trust by you for
us until we can decide on a suitable business
investment in your country upon our freedom.  
  
Please reply urgently and treat with absolute
confidentiality and sincerity.
  
  Best Regards,
  MARYAM ABACHA (MRS.)

FROM THE DESK:DR.JOHN UGBAJA,
ACCOUNT DEPARTMENT (NNPC)
FALOMO OFFICE COMPLEX,
IKOYI  LAGOS, NIGERIA
                                 
                                          



Dear Sir,

I am Dr. John  Ugbaja chairman- audit committee, with
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), I 
headed the audit committee whose assignment was to
audit, review and recommend payment for all contracts
awarded in the NNPC by the corrupt past military
administration. 
In the course of our review, we discovered that the
sum of USD 30 million (THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS) was
floating unclaimed in the corporation account without
beneficiary. This money emanated from an
over-invoicing in the contract awarded to a foreign
firm for the supply, fixing, erecting and computerized
optimization of oil pipeline to one of our oil
refineries during the past Military administration. 
Base on our status as senior government officials in
top sensitive position of trust, we cannot stand to
claim this money ourselves, hence, I decided to
contact you. All modalities for this transfer have
been fully worked out. We have already secured a
preliminary order to effect this payment, we now
require from you your BANKING PARTICULARS, FAX AND
TELEPHONE NUMBER for smooth transfer of this money
into your bank account. We intend to share the money
in the following manner: 30% for you, 65% for us and
5% for any miscellaneous expenses. This business is
100% risk-free. We look forward to a fruitful business
relationship with you.
Best Regards 

DR. JOHN    UGBAJA

Tel:234-803-3229674
Federal Airport Authority
of Nigeria (FAAN)
Ikeja - Nigeria


I hope this message will reach you in the best of
health and receive your prompt attention, even as we
have not had any previous correspondence before.
Kindly reach me immediately for details should you
agree to its contents. 

I am a principal accountant and the Chairman of the
Federal Tenders Board Committee to the Federal Airport
Authority of Nigeria (FAAN). This message is
to solicit for your kindness in assisting me to
transfer some amount of fund from my country to your
country. 

The total amount of fund is US$29.5Million
(twenty nine million, five hundred thousand United
States Dollars)which resulted from various contracts
awarded by my ministry to some foreign firms in which
the contract bills were slightly inflated by us
members of the Tenders Board Committee with the sole
aim of having the excess fund for our subsequent use.
Presently, all the foreign firms that executed the
projects concerned have been paid their bills
accordingly and the projects have been commissioned
for use. At this juncture, we now want to claim and
transfer the excess fund using a foreign company since
foreign contractors originally executed the contracts.
Also, we as civil servants are not allowed to operate
domiciliary nor foreign account, therefore, we cannot
claim this fund locally, hence the necessity for
thiscontact with you.
We have decided to embark on this transaction now that
we have new civilian administration. Our aim is to
present your name as a true beneficiary of the fund.

The total fund (US$29.5M) will then be remitted into
any designated bank account as shall be recommended by
you. The relevant authorities will be made to believe
that your company executed some contracts for my
ministry to which payment is due to effected. 

In this regard therefore, you will be required to
present a suitable bank account that will accommodate
the total amount of fund. The moment the bank account
details are received from you, it will only take a
maximum duration of 7-9working days to have all
documentations complied and the fund remitted to your
account.

On completion of this transaction, we have resolved to
give you 25% of the fund for your efforts and
assistance rendered; 5% will be used to settle any
expenses that might be incurred on the process of this
transaction both from our end and your end while the
remaining 70% will be for us. I will be  disposed to
giving the details of this proposal as soon as I

SAMUEL BEREGA

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

ATTN;


First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as
it is utterly confidential and top secret. You have
been recommended by an associate who assured me in
confidence of your ability and reliability to
prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a
pending business transaction requiring maximum
confidence. 

We are top officials of the Federal Government
contract review panel who are interested in
importation of goods into our Country with funds which
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence
this business, we solicit your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said trapped funds.

The source of this fund is as follows: during General
Abdulsalam Abubakar regime here in Nigeria, the
government officials set up companies and awarded
themselves contracts which were grossly over invoiced
in various ministries. The present Civilian Government
set up contract review panel and we have identified a
lot of inflated contract funds which are presently
floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for
payment. However, by virtue of our position as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire
this money in our names. I have therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would transfer the sum of US$25,000 000.00
(twenty five million UnitedStates Dollars) hence, we
are writing
you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money thus:
1 20% for the account owner (you)
2 70% for us (the officials)
3 10% to be used in settling taxation and all
local and foreign expenses.

It is from the 70% that we wish to commence the
importation business. Please note that this
transaction is 100% safe and we hope to commence the
transfer latest seven (7) Banking days from the date
of the receipt of the following information .

The above information will enable us write letter of
claim and job description respectively. This way, we
will use your Companys name to apply for payment and
re-award the contract in your Companys name. We are
looking forward to doing this business with you and
solicit your confidentiality in this transaction.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e-mail address. I will bring you into the
complete picture of this pending project when I have
heard from you.

Yours faithfully,

SAMUEL BEREGA.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I want to request your assistance and collaboration
to enable me transfer the payment of this over
invoiced contract claim to your bank account This
particular contract was awarded to a Foreign Contractor
and was inflated to the tune of US$36 561 000 00
Thirty Six Million Five Hundred and Sixty one
Thousand US Dollars Only

The foreign Contractor has received full payment for
the actual contract value leaving behind the sum of
US$36 561 000 00 which represents the over inflated
contract value Currently lying at the Central Bank of
Nigeria The inflated value of $36 561 000 00 was
meant to be a Kick Back to the Government officials
that awarded the contract These Government officials
have left their positions and they could not collect
the money before leaving office

As a result of updated payment advise at the Central
Bank the money has been discoverd to be awaiting transfer
to a Foreign Account Having done all the necessary
modalities this money is now in our possession and I am
looking for a trustworthy person into whose private or company's
account this money would be transferred into

Upon the transfer of this money 85% of the sum will
be for me 10% shall be for you the account owner
while the remaining 5% shall be set aside to refund
expenses made in the course of this transaction Be
assured that this business is entirely safe but I
demand absolute confidentiality due to the nature of the
transaction and my position in the ministry If you
are interested in this proposal please respond to me


Kindly treat as urgent

Yours faithfully

David Bismark

                 [URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL]
        
     (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD  
     ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS )  

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Fifty two million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to 
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable  and fit to provide either an existing
bank account  or  to set up a new  Bank a/c 
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in  you and believing  in God that
you  will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr. Cmore James, the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner
of this account is  Mr. Magnus Leon, a foreigner, and
a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Magnus
Leon until his death was the manager Magnus
Coy.(pty). SA.  

  
We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account, 

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US
Dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Magnus Leon is a foreigner too, [and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c] 

However, we will sign a binding agreement,  to bind us
together. I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer,  I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business,  you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply.
 
Yours,

Cmore James.

Dear Sir,


My name is MR GARUBA USENI the eldest son of Rtd
General JEREMAIAH.  J. T. USENI who was the est. while
Minister of the Federal Capital territory Abuja in the
late General Sani Abachas Regime of 1993-1998.
I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost
confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution
to a money transfer of $60M that is presently putting
my entire family into great disarray.  You may be
quite surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not
despair, I got your contact from a business site on
the internet and following the information I gathered
about you, I was convinced that you could be of
assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once
due to the urgency required for us to immediately
transfer the said funds out of the country.

During the time my father was in the government with
the late General Sani Abacha as the head of state,
they were both involved in several deals that yielded
Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals
was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the
importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the
Nigerian Defense, funds set to embark on an oversea
campaign to counter the United States action to put a
stop to the self succession bid of the Abachas
government to retain power, and monies set aside to
rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries
and the National Electric Power Authority which
supplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you are
conversant with world news, you would understand
better.

During this period my father was able to make some
good money for himself and kept in his private bank
accounts. The then head of state General Sani Abacha
transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese
businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman, Mark
Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all
the secrets were revealed by the investigation
agencies set up by the successive governments and most
of the Abachas loots were traced and repatriated from
the various accounts to the Federal Government
Treasury.

Out of the money my father made, he left the sum of
N50 Million (Fifty Million Naira) in the CBN escrow
account for further transfer into a foreign account
and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in
a Private security firm here in Nigeria. Through the
confessions made by the Abachas Family, the N50
Million was recovered by the investigating agency from
the CBN escrow account.  But were unable to discover
the $60M, which he kept in the vaults. The reason is
because no names were used to lodge in the funds.
Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (PIN)
and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury
Bills. Also the firm issued him with a certificate of
deposit of the consignments. Note that I have these
information in my custody.

Right now, my father has been arrested and detained
for interrogation. As the eldest son of my Father, I
believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to
ensure that the $60M is successfully transferred
abroad for investment purposes.  With the present
situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based
on this that I am making this contact with you. I have
done a thorough homework and fine-tuned the best way
to create you as the beneficiary to the funds and
effect the transfer accordingly.  Is rest assured that
the modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire
project guarantees our safety and the successful
transfer of the funds.  So, you will be absolutely
right when you say that this project is risk free and
viable. If you are capable and willing to assist,
contact me at once via email for more details.

Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.
All my fathers friends have deserted us after
exploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my
father. As it is said, it is at the time of problems
that you know your true friends.  So long as you keep
everything to yourself, we would definitely have no
problems. For your assistance, I am ready to give you
as much as 20% of the total funds after transfer and
invest a reasonable percentage into any viable
business you may suggest.

Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and
please; do not undermine it because it will also be a
source of up liftment to you also.  You have
absolutely nothing to loose in assisting us instead,
you have so much to gain.

Awaiting your urgent and positive response.

BEST REGARDS,

MR GARUBA USENI

BARRISTER  TONY IBE



FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,

I Wish to solicit your kind and urgent assistance.

My name is Mr. tony ibe, a lawyer based in Lagos state of Nigeria.

As a lawyer, I was a private legal adviser (for almost two decades)
to a white couple who unfortunately lost their lives three months ago
in a ghastly motor accident here in Nigeria. prior to their death,
this white couple had lived in this country since 1960's as
missionaries and educationists, Unfortunately they died childless,
with no known relatives or next of kin.

The issue at stake, for which i am writing you now, is that the
deceased left behind the sum of $12.5million in their joint account
with ZENITH BANK PLC. soon after the burial of the deceased, I had
promptly notified the bank, which is awaiting me to present to them
the person that is to inherit the account of the deceased,
incidentally, as I said before, the late couple had no known next of
kin or relatives. No one else knows about this.

However, it will amount to abuse of privilege for me to lay claim to
the wealth and estate of the deceased, since as a black man icouldn't
have been their relative. But then the money can't be left to thebank
permanently/forever. so I have decided to contact you, to seek your
consent to present your name to the bank as the next of kin and the
appointed administrator/inheritor of the estates of the deceased. As
a whiteman, you'll fit into the picture.

As the lawyer to the deceased, no body can disbelieve me if i present
you as the next of kin to the deceased. Moreover, I know the exact
legal requirements and documents to secure in your favour to show
proof that you are actually the next of kin/inheritor of everything
left behind by the deceased. All these will be my responsibility to
obtain from the court here in Nigeria. you won't be needed here in
person.

I can assure you that this is my specialty and there is nothing for
you to be afraid of. I will handle and provide all that it will take
legally. once everything need is done, the bank will be satisfied to
transfer the fund from the account of the deceased to yours.

My interest is to take 60% of the funds while you take 30%, then the
remaining 10% will be disbursed to any	Orphanage-Home of our common
choice.

Please communicate your decision to me urgently, keep these
confidential.

Sincerely yours, 

Barrister tony ibe.

LAGOS - NIGERIA 
Dear Sir,    
                      URGENT ATTENTION 

BUSINESS TRANSFER OF US$25.5M ( TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) 
I am the New Auditor General to Audit Government 
Account for this 2002 year budget, during my 
auditing, I discovered that there was an over invoiced

amount of US$25.5 Million, in United States Dollars
Equivalent. 
The above amount is floating after my auditing,since 
it was an over - invoice amount, this means that the 
money is from a contract executed by a Foreigner and 
the real contract sum was paid remaining the floating
amount of US$25.5M. 
Based on this development, I cannot claim this money 
except with the help of a Foreign Partner, this is my 
main reasons for contacting you. Now , I got your 
contact from your Country's profile abroad and 
I reserve your contact for this kind of transaction
with trust. 
What you have to do is to send a reply mail telling me

that you are interested in this transaction and trust 
worthy to handle this transaction for me, because I 
will put your company's name as the Contractor that 
executed the contract before and the money will be 
wired transferred to your bank account, I will then 
travel to meet you in your country for my own share 
when this amount is wired to your account. 
I would have travel out to open an account myself for 
this transfer, but as a Civil Servant I am not allowed

to operate foreign bank account while in services , 
hence the need for an overseas partner. 
I got your contact from your country's profil 
abroad and I have put it that the money when 
transferred to your bank account will be shared as
follows: 
1. 30% to you for acting as the owner of 
the money and for providing an accou! nt. 2. 10% set 
aside for anyexpenses that may be 
incurred in the course of the transaction (if any). 
3. 60% to me as the owner / originator of the
transaction 
All logistics have been put in place and all 
modalities worked out for the smooth 
conclusion of the transaction within a very short 
period of time within (14) Fourteen working days after
the receipt of 
information required like your company's name, 
telephone and fax number, bank details for wire
transfer process. 
As soon as I receive the above details I shall make the

application in your name and file in for claims to 
the appropriate Ministries concerned in favour of your

company. It is pertinent to state here that this 
transaction is entirely based on trust and I will
always put my trust in you. 
Acknowledge the receipt of this mail using 
my e-mail only please don't reply through any other

Attn. sir,  

             PLEASE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
        REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

I am DR. FRED  IKEM. The financial controller of
theNigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)
Headquarters lagos. I am writing on behalf of my
colleagues in (NNPC) and have been assigned to seek
for the assistance of a reliable foreign company
through which we can transfer the sum of TWENTY
MILLION U.S DOLLARS ONLY (US$20,000,000). This money
is deposited in the NNPC Treasury account with the
Central Bank of Nigeria. ORIGIN OF THE FUND: This sum
arose from the deliberated over-invoicing of a
contract awarded by my ministry (NNPC) to foreign firm
in the twilight days of the last military regime. This
contract has been completely executed and commissioned
and the contractor that handled this contract has
collected his full and final payment thus leaving
behind the above stated amount which represent the
over invoiced sum. We have been safeguarding this
money for conducive time for its transfer out of the
country for our personal use. However, the code of
employment does not allow us (civil servant) to own
and operate foreign account and because the contract
was handled by a foreign firm and the payment made in
dollars, we now need a foreign partner that will
present himself as the subcontractor so that the fund
will be transfered into your companys or personal
account. Your address was made available to us by a
very good friend who work with the Nigeria export
promotion council and he assured us of your companys
viability and capability in business transaction. This
assurance gave us the courage to link you up in this
particular transaction and I hope it will be of mutual
benefit to all of us. Note that the nature of your
business is not particularly relevant to the success
of the transaction. All we require is your willingness
to present yourself as the subcontractor by providing
your bank information so that the fund will betransferred into your account. 
SHARING RATIO: For your assistance in this business ,
your share will be 30% of the total fund. I and my
colleagues will take 60% while we set aside 10% for
any expenses that may be incurred in the course of
this transaction. If you are willing to assist us in
this business. Send the following information. (1).
Name of your bank and address (2). Your account
number/beneficiarys name. (3). Your private telephone
and fax numbers for easy communication. This
information will enable us put an application for
payment approval to the concerned Ministries and
finally to the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N) and it
is going to last for 6-7 working days starting  from
the day we receive the above information. All
modalities for the takeoff of this transaction have
been worked out and further action will commence
immediately we hear from you. I am waiting for your
reply via my private e-mail address:
ikemfred01@accountant.com only  for security reasons. 

Yours faithfully,
Dr. FRED IKEM.

FROM THE DESK OF: PAUL COKER
LAGOS - NIGERIA.
Email:paulcoker@linuxmail.org


Dear FRIEND,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

It is with my profound dignity that I write you this very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and "TOP SECRET". Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met each other
before,but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of
this transaction,as we have been reliably informed that it will take
at least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal post to reach
you, so we decided it is best using the e-mail.

However, let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am
BELLO MUSA, a Director General in the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) and I presently head a seven man tenders board in
charge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to know of
you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very
confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum CONFIDENCE.
I and my colleagues are Top Officials of the Federal Government
Contract Review and Award Panel. Our duties include Evaluation,
Vetting, Approval for payment of Contract jobs done for the N.N.P.C
e.t.c. In order to commence this business we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your Account the said funds.

The source of this funds is as follows: In the first quarter of 2001
this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune
of US$400 million US dollars to a group of five firms for the supply
, construction and installation of Oil Pipe lines in Warri and Port
Harcourt. During this process my colleagues and I decided and agreed
among ourselves to deliberately over-inflate the total contract sum
from US$400 million to US$428 million United States dollars with the
main intention of sharing the remaining sum of US$28 miilion
amongst ourselves.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has since last year approved the
sum of US$428 million for us as the contract sum, and the sum of
US$400 million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned
as contract entitlements for the various contracts done, but since
the companies are entiltled to US$400 million dollars only, we are
now left with US$28 million dollars balance in the account which we
intend to disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our positions
as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot do this by
ourselves, as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil
Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our
names while still in Government service, making it impossible for us
to acquire the money in our names right now. I have therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would
transfer the sum of US$28 million. Hence we are writing you this
letter.

My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your company can act
as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf, you or your Company
will retain 20% of the total amount (US$28 million), while 60% will
be for us (OFFICIALS) and the remaining 20% will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. You must however NOTE that this
transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and
conditions as we have stated below;

a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds
once it is under your custody, or any form of blackmail.
c) That upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as
instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20% from the
total amount.

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and risk free and we
hope to conclude this transaction seven bank working days from the
date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .. We are
looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your Total
Confidentiality in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I
give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with
us. Transactions like this have been successfully carried out in the
past by most Government executives. Here in my country there is great
economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is
rampant and the order of the day, thus explaining why you might have
heard stories of how money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is
because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future, so that when we retire from active service we donot languish
in poverty. I will explain more to you when I have heard from you.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e-mail
address. I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending
business transaction when I have heard from you and also receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our pending business
transaction. I will also send to you my private telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us transfer
the funds under this quarter of the year 2002.

Thank you and God Bless.

Yours faithfully,

PAUL COKER

N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL
AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY LAUNDERING.

       RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD)
      ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS
 
Dear sir,

In order to transfer out (USD 126 MILLION) One hundred
and twenty six million United States Dollars from
DEVELOPMENT BANK FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA [DBSA]. I wish to

ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest
person who will be capable and fit to provide either
an existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can also serve for this purpose.But if you can help me
I will apprecite it.

I am Mr KING EDWINSON,the Auditor General of
Development Bank For Southern Africa, during the
course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund in
an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993
nobody has operated on this account again, after going
through some old files, from the records I discovered
that the owner of the account died without an heir
hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this
money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.
The owner of this account is Mr. Allan P. Seaman, a
foreigner, and an industrialist, and he died, since
1993 and no other person knows about this account or
any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Allan P. Seaman until his death was the manager
Diamond Safari [pty]. SA.

We will start the first transfer with Twenty Six
Million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount
to your account, 

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
money cannot be approved to a local person here, but
can only be approved to any foreigner with valid
information about Mr. 
Allan P. Seaman who is a foreigner too. 

However, I am revealing this to you with believe in
God that you will never let me down when the money
enters your A/C. 

Send also your private telephone and fax number
including the full details of the account to be used
for the deposit

I need your full understanding and co-operation to
make this work fine because the management of the Bank
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who
has correct information of this account, which I will
give to you, upon your positive response. Two of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the money going into the account.

I will use my position and influence to obtain all
legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to
your account with appropriate clearance from the
relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments
for easy and smooth transfer of the fund into your
account without question.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring this money.

I am looking forward to hear from you. 

Yours truly

KING EDWINSON.

I am Dr. (Mrs.) Maryam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian
Head of State-General Sani Abacha. I am proposing this
 business to you because we could be of great assistance 
to each other, likewise developing a cordial business
 relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum
 of Eighty Five Million United States Dollar
(US$85,000.000.00) cash that I intend to use for
 investment purposes specifically in your country. 

This money came as a result of a pay back
 contractdeal between my late husband and a Russian 
firm on our country's Multi-billion Dollar Ajaokuta 
Steel Plant.The Russian partners returned my husband's
 share of US$85 million after his death and lodged it
 with my husband's security firm in Nigeria of which I 
am a director. Right now, the new civilian government
 has revoked our licenses to own and operate financial
 and oil companies in what is part of concerted efforts 
to break the financial powers of my family by our 
arch-enemies who now form the majority in the 
Chief Olusegun Obasanjo led government.In view 
of this ugly development, I acted very fast in 
withdrawing the US$85 million from the company's 
vault well preserved and packaged in trunk boxes and
 deposited it in ECOWAS Security Bank. 

I have since declared our security company bankrupt.
No record ever existed concerning the money neither is 
the money traceable by the government because there is
 no document showing that we received the money from
 the Russians. Due to the present situation in the country
 regarding the government's attitude towards my family, 
it has become quite impossible for me to make use of 
the money within the country, hence I seek your 
assistance to move the money out of this country. 

On your consent, I shall expect you to contact me
 urgently to enable us discuss this transaction in detail.
 Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to 
transfer this fund and the transaction will be mutually 
beneficial. Your urgent response is required.

Dear Sir,

Good Day,I know this letter will come to you as a
suprise expecially for the fact that we have not met
or seen before. However,be rest assured that it is of
good intensions. I am contacting you with due respect

beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction.

I am MR EMMANUEL ADAMS,The Director and Officer in
Charge Audit Department (B.O.A) Bank of Africa Abidjan

the Bank by the end of last year 2001, I and my
partner came across the huge amount of money million
dollars (US$ 18.5 M) which has been dormant in the
general trust/suspence account since 1995. From my
investigation and findings the fund was deposited by a
foreigner (deceased) who died during a plane crash in
1999. And since then the account has been dormant
without claim from any person or persons.

To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance and
co-operation to come in as the next of kin to the
deceased/ beneficiary to this fund and apply for the
claim for our mutual benefit. 

Be informed that all the process would be monitored
here by me, until you comfirm receipt of this fund
into your designated account. 

After which it should be shared as follows: 30% for
you, 5% for any expenses incurred in the course of
this transfer locally and internationlly while 65%
will be for me /partner.

Be rest assured that this transfer is risk
free,as all arrangements for the hitch free transfer
of this fund have been put in place.


Also this transaction should be treated with utmost
confidentiality and urgency as we are still in service
and intend to resign immediately this fund gets into
your account. 

If you are ready and capable of handling this business
with us, urgently get back to me through my private
e-mail address to enable us discuss and proceed for
immediate action.

Thanks for your anticipated cooperation. As I look

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL



I am Dr. ROTIMI ADEMOLA the chairman of contract award

and review committee set up by the federal government

of Nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to

award new contracts and review existing ones.



I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and

Reputable person to handle a very confidential

transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum

of money to a foreign account. There were series of

contracts executed by a consortium of multinationals

in the oil industry in favour of N.N.P.C. the original

value of these contracts were deliberately over

invoiced to the sum of Usd$25,000,000.00 (twenty five

million united state Dollars).



This amount has now been approved and is now ready to

be transferred being that the companies that actually

executed these contracts have been fully paid and the

projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my

colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total

amount to your account for subsequent disbursement,

since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code

of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating

and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless

to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is

enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20%

of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside

for Incidental expenses (internal and external)

between both parties in the course of the transaction

you will be mandated to remit the balance to other

accounts in due course.



Modalities have been worked out at the highest level

of the ministry of finance and the central bank of

Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within

14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the

above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is

Risk free and to accord this transaction the legality

It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the

whole approval procedures will officially and legally

processed with your name or the name of any company

you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary. Once

more I want you to understand that having put in over

twenty five years in the civil service of my country,

I am averse to having my image and career dented. This

matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy

and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify

your intention to assist by sending me a fax on my

confidential fax number ( 234 1 7596976 ) so that I

can brief you further. I want to assure you that this

business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done

our homework properly. I quite believe that you will

protect our interest by taking this deal strictly

confidential, as we are still in government service,

which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action

as we are behind schedule to enable us include this

transfer in the first batch which would constitute the

third quarter payments for the 2002 financial year.



Thanks and God bless.



Dr. ROTIMI ADEMOLA.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

It is with heart full of hope that I write to seek
your help in the context below. I am Mr. claudio
Kabila, the second son of the late Laurent Kabila
Former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DPC) whose sudden death occurred  January 2001.
Having gotten your particulars from my countries
chamber of commerce/information centre, I have no
doubt to your capacity and goodwill
to assist me in receiving into your custody (for
safety) the sum of US$36 million willed and deposited
in the favor of myself and my mother who is the second
wife of the late president.

This money is currently kept in a trust deposit vault
with a  Finance and Security company. However, the new
Government headed by my step brother Joseph has on
assumption of office setup an enquiry to recover all
the assets belonging to my late dad including cash and
properties with the pretence of safe-keepings, but
with actual intention of personal inheritance. All
this because we are from a polygamous family. The
investigation teams have submitted their report;
presently some cash and assets have been seized.

Fortunately, I managed to escape from the country, and
with the help of a lawyer, I am presently leaving as a
refuge here until I succeed in this transfer
transaction and due to the situation of things the
lawyer has strictly advised that the willed money be
urgently moved into an over-seas account of a trusted
Foreign family friend without delay for security
reasons. I expect you to be trustworthy and kind
enough to respond to this call (S.O.S) to save me and
my entire family from a hopeless future.

I hereby agree to compensate your sincere effort in
this regard with 20% of the fund,  when finally received
in your local Bank account. The attorneys here have
perfected arrangements with the security company to
effect complete dislodgement of this money within a
week of the receipt of your response ,They have
equally guaranteed 100% risk free and smooth transfer.
The arttorney contact is as follows
Barrister ROBERT. WILLIAMS
TEL:234-8033034130 
Looking Forward to your quick response. 

May God bless you.

Best Wishes
Mr. Claudio Kabila.

Dear Sir, 

First I must solicit your strictest confidence in this
transaction. 
This is by its nature being a transaction, which needs
maximum secrecy.
 
I am Mr Muyiwa Ige, the eldest son of Late Chief  Bola
Ige, who was the Attorney - General of the Federation
and Minister of Justice 
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He was
assassinated on the 23rd of December 2001 in his
hometown Ibadan - Oyo state. We have every reason to
believe that his political opponents killed him as a
result of his ambition to run again for the 2003
presidential election in my country that he contested
on the platform of ALLIANCE FOR DEMOCRACY {A.D} and
lost to the present head of state Gen Olusegun
Obasanjo {Rtd}. At the moment, the Government has
commenced investigation into his death although we
{Family} do not have confidence in what they may come
out as a result of the investigation.

Before his death, he kept  2 boxes which contained the
sum of $34 million united stated dollars in my
possession . He  wanted to use this money to run for
his presidential election , while his confidant
Mr.Atiku Idris had wanted to contest for  senatorial
election in the year 2003,unfortunately my father
could not make it. Now that my father has been
murdered, Mr.Atiku has vowed to have nothing  to do
with politics after the shock of my fathers death, and
called a meeting between me him and my mother.
During my recent meeting with my mother, we agreed to
channel money into investment abroad and that I should
look for a reliable foreign partner who would help me
transfer the money abroad.
This is why I am seeking and contacting you, if you
succeed in helping me transfer this money outand
putting it into investment, 25% of the money would be
given to you,5% would be used for unforeseen expenses,
the remaining 70% would be for us down here  ,while
the money would be invested in any good business in
your country.

I want to assure you that this transaction is 100%
risk free both now and in future as all necessary
arrangement has been made for a hitch free transfer.
Please try and get back to me as soon as you receive
my mail.
 
I pray to hear from you soonest.

Warmest regards,

Muyiwa Ige.

ATTN;

I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, widow of the Late Gen. Sani
Abacha former Nigerian Military Head  of State who
died as a result of cardiac arrest.
 The name of you company appeared in one of our directories as one of the 
companies my late husband wanted to do businesswith before he died.
I therefore decided to contact you in confidence so
that I can be able to move out the sum of US$35,760,000.00 ( Thirty Five 
Million Seven hundred and Sixty Thousand U. S. Dollars ) which was secretly
defaced and seal in  big  metal box for security reasons in your account.

. Upon the receipt of your acceptance to assist me, my lawyer shall arrange
with you for a face to face meeting outside Nigeria in
order to liaise with him towards the effective completion of this transaction.
However, arrangement has been put in place to move
this money out of the country in batches in a secret 
vault through a diplomatic security company to any of
the  European country as soon as you indicate your
interest. I also want you to be assured that all
necessary arrangement for the hitch-free of thistransaction has been 
concluded.
Conclusively, I have decided to offer you 25% of the
total sum 5% will be for whatever expenses that will
be incurred, while 70% is to be used in buying share
in your company subsequent to our free movement by theNigerian government.
Please reply urgently and treat with 
absoluteconfidentiality and sincerity.

>From Alexander Dkamaka.  
Attn: President/C.E.O

  Sir,

  I am Alexander Dkamaka, a top management staff in the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a seven-man tender's board
in charge of Contract Awards and Payments Approvals. I came to know of
you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very
confidential transaction that involves the transfer of a huge sum of
money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by 
a consortium Multinationals in the oil industry in favour of NNPC among
which were:

  1. The Supply of Y2K Compliant Personal Computers and Accessories to
the Warri, Port Harcourt and Kaduna Refineries.
  2. Supply of Drugs and Relief materials to the victims of the Niger/
Delta crises.
  3. The construction of Schools, Hospitals and Housing Units in the
Niger/Delta Region.

  The original value of these contracts was deliberately over invoiced
in the sum of TWENTY EIGHT MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS (28.6M) Which has now been approved and is now ready to be
transferred, being that the Companies that actually executed these 
contracts have been paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to 
your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants we 
are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from 
opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to 
say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous.

 In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, 
while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and 
external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be 
mandated to remit the balance 70% to other accounts in due course. You 
must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the
following terms and conditions:

  Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence. That you
would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. 
That as a foreign partner, you will follow our instructions to the 
letter. Provide the account required, and competent to assist us on
profitable investment areas in your Country in an advisory capacity. 
Furthermore, Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the 
Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate 
transfer of the funds within 10 working days subject to your 
satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk 
free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual 
security of the fund, the whole approval procedures will be officially 
and legally processed with your name or any Company you may nominate as 
the Bonafide beneficiary. Once more, I want you to understand that 
having put in over 26 years in the service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This
matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include
this transfer in the second quarter of this financial year.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this message via my email.  

NOTE:PLEASE FURNISH ME WITH YOUR TEL/FAX# SO THAT I COULD SEND ACROSS
DETAILS OF THE TRANSFER AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FOR YOUR 
ENDORSEMENT TO ENABLE US TRANSFER THE FUNDS TO YOUR PROVIDED ACCOUNT.
I AWAIT YOUR
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE.

  Yours Sincerely,

Dear Sir, 

I solicit your confidence in this transaction that I 
propose to you. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. 

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude 
will make any one apprehensive and worried but I am 
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the

I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of 
this transaction. Your discreteness and ability to >handle a transaction of this nature is of 
the uttermost importance. Let me start by introducing 
myself properly to you. 

I am Chief Godwin Emeh, Executive Director with 
Zenith International Bank Limited. Lagos Nigeria. I 
came to know of you in my private search on 
the Internet for a reliable and reputable person to >handle this confidential transaction which involves 
the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign 
account requiring maximum confidence. 

PROPOSITION: A foreigner, Late Engineer Michael 
Clayson, an oil merchant/contractor with the Federal 
Government of Nigeria, until his death 
a year ago in a ghastly plane crash, operated an 
offshore account with Zenith International Bank 
Limited and had a closing balance of account 
as at the end of May 2001 worth U.S$38.6M 
(thirty-eight million Six Hundred Thousand United 
States Dollars). 

The bank now expects a next of kin to claim the money 
as a beneficiary. However, efforts are being made by 
the Bureau of Public Investigations to get in touch 
with any of the Claysons family or relatives but 
there has been no success. 

As a result of the perceived possibility of not being 
able to locate any of Late Engr. Michael Clayson next 
of kin (he had no wife nor children that is 
known to us), the management under the influence of 
our Chairman, Dr. Jim Ovia and members of the board of 
directors that includes a Minister in the present 
Government resolved to declare the fund UNCLAIMABLE 

This fund when declared UNCLAIMABLE, will be donated 
to OAU and ECOWAS projects. These projects include 
peace-keeping forces in Liberia, Sierra-Leone and 
Africa in general. This intention of Mr. Chairman I 
believe is to gain favor for the bank from the Federal 
Government of Nigeria translating to huge profit for 
the bank. 

I am personally against this donation because from 
experience, there is no so called PEACE-KEEPING 
without arms and ammunition. By this. the sum 
of $38.5 Million when donated will be use to procure 
more arms and ammunitions. For the sake of humanity, 
this is an evil alternative. 

In order to avert this negative development, some of 
my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission 
to have you stand as a next of kin to 
Late Engr. Michael Clayson so that the fund U.S.$38.6M 
would be released and paid into your account as the 
beneficiary next of kin. 

All documents and proof to enable you get this fund 
will be carefully worked out, we have secured from the 
probate from the High Court an order of mandamus to 
locate any next of kin. 

This order by the High Court has made the transaction 
100% risk free. Following the conclusion of this 
transfer, the sharing will be thus: (1)=30% 
of the money will go to your account for acting as the 
of the fund; (2)=10% will be set aside for 
reimbursement to both parties for any expenses that 
may be incurred in the course of the transfer ; 
(3)=60% to me and my trusted colleagues as the 
architects of this transaction. 

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not 
hesitate to contact me as soon as possible. You will 
have to send your most confidential Telephone/Fax 
numbers so that I can relay confidential information - 
as they come in directly to you. 

Thanking you in advance for your anticipated 
cooperation. God Bless. 

Yours Faithfully, 

CHIEF GODWIN EMEH 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK LIMITED

Hello Dear

I am AUGUSTINE CHIDI, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OFNIGERIA, Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.

On August 6 1997, an American oil
consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation:
Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.
 
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident.

 
On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare anynext of kin in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork.

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year.No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 5(five) years, the money will revert to the
ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.

This is simple I will like you to provide me
immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.
 
We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of administration from the probate registry in your favor, to enable you take possesion of the money.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful and confidential execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately .
 
Upon your response, I shall then provide
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand better.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Please note that the similarity of the name of the deceased does not matter.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Regard

AUGUSTINE CHIDI

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr. ROTIMI ADEMOLA the chairman of contract award
and review committee set up by the federal government
of Nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to
award new contracts and review existing ones.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
Reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum
of money to a foreign account. There were series of
contracts executed by a consortium of multinationals
in the oil industry in favour of N.N.P.C. the original
value of these contracts were deliberately over
invoiced to the sum of Usd$25,000,000.00 (twenty five
million united state Dollars).

This amount has now been approved and is now ready to
be transferred being that the companies that actually
executed these contracts have been fully paid and the
projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my
colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total
amount to your account for subsequent disbursement,
since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code
of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating
and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless
to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is
enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20%
of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside
for Incidental expenses (internal and external)
between both parties in the course of the transaction
you will be mandated to remit the balance to other
accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the ministry of finance and the central bank of
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within
14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the
above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is
Risk free and to accord this transaction the legality
It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the
whole approval procedures will officially and legally
processed with your name or the name of any company
you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary. Once
more I want you to understand that having put in over
twenty five years in the civil service of my country,
I am averse to having my image and career dented. This
matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy
and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify
your intention to assist by sending me a fax on my
confidential fax number ( 234 1 7596976 ) so that I
can brief you further. I want to assure you that this
business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done
our homework properly. I quite believe that you will
protect our interest by taking this deal strictly
confidential, as we are still in government service,
which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action
as we are behind schedule to enable us include this
transfer in the first batch which would constitute the
third quarter payments for the 2002 financial year.

Thanks and God bless.

Dr. ROTIMI ADEMOLA.

also to front for me in the areas of business you desire profitable. 

This sum of US$15M has secretly been deposited into a confidential Security Company, 
where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended beneficiary. The funds will be 
released to you by the Security Company based on my recommendations, on that note, you 
will be presented as my partner who will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent 
ventures. 

To show my preparedness and the appreciation to conduct this business with you, I shall 
give you and your family 20% of the funds and 20% commission on any profit realizable in 
the process of investment of this funds. For your role in this business, we are willing to make 
available 5% for any eventual cost that may occur in the process of this transaction. 

Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this business 
ventures, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly required, due to my family present 
predicament. 

I sincerely will appreciate your acknowledgement by fax or telephone as soon as possible.

Dear Sir,


I am Mr Marshall Kabba the first son of Mr. Fedrick
Tija kabba the Sierra-Leonean former Chairman Of
Distribution And Revenue Generation of The Diamond
Sector. Your contact address came to me through the
curtsey of your embassy high commission commercial
sector in federal rep of nigeria. Though this
project was not made known to them during the inquiry.
 
                                 
I want you to assist me to claim the sum of
$24.000.000.00(Twenty Four Million US Dollars) left
for me by my father who until his death was the
chairman of Revenue Generation and Distribution of
Diamond sector before the civil war. He died of
injuries he sustained in a motor accident while
returning from Freetown our capital city after an
official conference meeting, may his soul rest in
peace.

                                 
The last WILL testament of my father is with the
executor of the WILL.But the money is coded and
deposited with a security company in lome togo  a
neighbouring country.  
                                 
At his sick bed,before he gave up, my father advised
me to seek an assistance of an honest foreigner to
help me in transferring the money out of the country.
The foreigner will open a domiciliary account
in his favour in Cotonou for onward transfer to the
person's designated overseas account where the money
will be properly invested with the assistance of the
person.  
                                 
This is because there are no good investment
opportunities in this country now due to the political
instability, secondly I have decided to live in your
country after this fund has been transferred to your 
country for investment.  
                                 
I am therefore soliciting for your assistance but with
the following conditions:  
                                 
1. That this transaction shall be treated with utmost
confidence, co-operation and absolute secrecy.  
                                 
2. That the money will be transferred to an account
where much tax shall not take so much of it.  
                                 
3. I have decided to give you 20% of the total money
towards your successful assistance to this
business,having set aside 5% to cover all local 
and International expenses as may arise from this
transfer activity for which all the parties involved
will have to contribute to,while the balance of 75%
will be credited to my account.                
             
    
4. An agreement of acceptance shall be written, signed
and stamped by you which will proof that my 70% of the
money will be kept safe for me until I arrive your
country immediately after the transfer. If my
conditions are not acceptable,feel free to make
recommendations as I will make myself available for
feasible conditions that will suite you for the
success of the transaction.
                                 
If you are interested in the proposal and decides to
assist me kindly,when replying try to include your
telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. I am
currently in the refugee camp in nigeria.

Thanks in anticipation.  
                                 
Yours sincerely

Dear Friend,

I must solicit your confidence in this assistance, this is by virtue as been utterly confidential and top secret.
I am Mrs. Ishaya Mark Aku, the wife of late Engr. Ishaya Mark Aku. My late husband who was the former minister of sports in my country died of the recent plane crash in air bus (A3 1 0 -30) flight EAS 430 of Saturday 4th May,2002. Now my late husband's personal assistant revealed to me that my husband when he was in office awarded a contract to a foreign contractor on supply of stadium equipments and building re-construction. The contract awarded to this foreign contractor was over estimated by US10.5 Million, which is already released and paid into a fictitous account nominated by my late husband before his sudden death. Because of his death we cannot continue or run this fictitous account. Then with the help of the local bank manager, the personal assistant requested the family to nominate a foreign account of our choice where the over estimated sum would be paid into for family use. But due to my condition as a civil servant, it is against the code of conduct as public serv!
!
ant to run foreign account.
This is why immediately after my husband's burial on Friday 10th May, 2002 I started my Internet Search for a reliable person that has the fear of God and the feelings of a widow to assist me in this issue and who can provide any foreign account for us to transfered this money into for use or for investment either here or outside the country. On your indication to help us though it may come as a disturbance and intrusion to your time schedule, you will be greatly rewarded even with percentage if you indicate your interest in helping us out and this will be greatly appreciated. 
Please do not hesitate to let me know what it will take me for your assistance and indicating your interest in helping me and my family by replying back as soon as you recieved this letter. 

Moreso treat as urgent and confidential.

Please contact me immediately on my email address (mrs_ishaya@mail.com) for more clarification.

Thanks for your co-operation and assistance.

Mrs. Ishaya Aku

Sir/Madam,

May I briefly introduce myself. I am Mr. Kalua Bamti of
 the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire)
 and the former aide de camp of the Late President Laurent
 Kabila of blessed memory.

I am presently living in Nigeria on asylum. In case
you are wondering how I got your contact, I got your
contact from a source at my country's embassy in Nigeria.

The events of the past one year in my country has been
very unfortunate. The Late President Kabila
successfully toppled the very corrupt government of
the Late Dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and ruled justly
and peacefully for a few months. Unfortunately, the
Tutsi from Goma, the Northern part of the country
rebelled against his government and since then my
country has been at war.

I am very dedicated and committed to winning the war
against the rebels until recently when to my shock I
found out that Senior Army Officers and Government
officials were stealing public funds and looting
government treasury and sending them to foreign
countries. They have exploited the war situation to
bring back the lawlessness and corruption of the
Mobutu days.

Afterthe late President Kabila was assassinated in very
questionable circumstances, I knew I was in danger of
losing from both ends. Due to this development and as
a way of survival, I have joined the train. I have in
my possession funds amounting to US$15.5Million. In
the usual manner of conveying such funds, the money is
in defaced form in a trunk box for security reasons.
It is now in the safe custody of a security company.
The company is however not aware of the real contents
of the trunk box.

My problem is that the Financial Laws of Nigeria does
not give asylum seekers any financial rights. And
because of the economic instability and religious
crisis, I have decided that it will be unwise to
attempt investing the funds here. The climate here is
very unfavourable and as a result, I have not
disclosed even to my hosts anything about this fund.

Now I am seeking foreign assistance to transfer the
funds overseas. If you can assist, I am willing to
give you 20% of the funds, that is US$3.1Million. You
will understand that my entire life and future depend
on this money and I shall be very grateful if you can
assist me. The major thing I demand from you is the
absolute assurance that the money will be safe and you
will not sit on it when it is shipped and then transfered to your
account.

If you are ready to be of assistance, please contact
me immediately by e-mail, so that I can furnish you
with the modalities for the transaction and what is
expected of you. I shall be most grateful if you
maintain utmost confidentiality and keep this message
entirely to yourself.

Due to the nature of this transaction, I
 would like you to contact me immediately.
 Please also forward any correspondence to balewa@mail.com
 I await your urgent response.


Best Regards,

Mr. Kalua Bamti.

DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES 
PLOT 225 KOFO ABAYOMI STREET VICTORIA ISLAND,LAGOS, NIGERIA.
DIRECT FAX: 234 1 759 0904. TEL; 234 1- 7591519
ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
RE: URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
Dear Sir,

I am CHIEF MIKE KPOKPOmember committee of the above department
Terms of Reference
My term of reference involves the award of contracts to multinational companies.
My office is saddled with the responsibility of contract award, screening, categorization and prioritization of projects embarked upon by Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as well as feasibility studies for selected projects and supervising the project consultants involved. A breakdown of the fiscal expenditure by this office as at the end of last fiscal quarter of 2000 indicates that DPR paid out a whooping sum of US$736M(Seven Hundred And Thirty Six Million, United States Dollars) to successful contract beneficiaries. The DPR is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid for the third Quarter of 2002.
The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the DPR deliberately over invoiced the contract value of the various contracts awarded. In the course of disbursements, this department has been able to accumulate the sum of US$38.2M(Thirty-eight Million, two hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) as the over-invoiced sum. This money is currently in a suspense account of the DPR account with the Debt Reconciliation Committee (DRC). We now seek to process the transfer of this fund officially as contract payment to you as a foreign contractor, who will be fronting for us as the beneficiary of the fund. In this way we can facilitate these funds into your nominated account for possible investment abroad. We are not allowed as a matter of government policy to operate any foreign account to transfer this fund into.
However, for your involvement in assisting us with this transfer into your nominated account we have evolved a sharing formula as follows:
(1) 20% for you as the foreign partner
(2) 75% for I and my colleagues

(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both Locally and Internationally during the course of this transaction.
We shall be relying on your advice as regard investment of our share in any business in your country. Be informed that this business is genuine and 100% safe considering the high-power government officials involved. Send your private fax/telephone numbers. Upon your response we shall provide you with further information on the procedures. Feel free to send response by Fax: 234-1-7590904 / TEL: 234-1-7591519 expecting your response urgently. All enquiries should be directed to the undersigned by FAX OR PHONE.
Looking forward to a good business relationship with you.
Sincerely,
CHIEF MIKE KPOKPO

To your Good Attention

My name is Mr. Idris A.Alameyah. I was a director in ministry of
Land and Natural Resources in the Western Saharan Republic. 

My country is of about 10 million people,very happy and rich but
developing. I have an offer to make to you which will benefit both
of us.

Through the award of contracts to three German Companies in three
years, I was able to make US$55 million. Due to the small size of my
country, if this fund is injected into the economy, it will instantly
attract suspicion so I decided to use a foreigner to secure it out of
Western Sahara. I have properly rendered and closed the accounts for
the three years last December of 2001 and so the US$55 Million is
safely 
mine now.

The money is secured in two separate ways of US$25m and US$30m. Due
to our poor banking system here I want you to assist me to secure the
funds for me in
Europe. You will have to travel to the European nation, which I will
later tell you and secure the funds for me. For this assistance, I
will give you US$10million. The rest will be mine and you will also
help me in investing it in real estates and other
profitable businesses. This transaction is planned to be concluded
quickly. I will give you the necessary documentations to claim
ownership of the money on my
behalf. The documentations will officially legalize the transaction
in your name so that it will be completely safe for both of us.
I am also aware of the attention large movement of funds attract
now
since the September 11th 2001 attack on New York, so I will provide
you with Clearance Certificate.

Once again, I assure you it is going to be a risk free transaction. 
Once 
I get your response, I will give you further information/details
of how we are going to
quickly and safely conclude the transaction and start investments.

I await your response through my above e-mail address.

Best regards,


Mr.Idris A.Alameyah

Dear Sir,

Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction.
This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL. 

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you first by your
email due to the urgency of this transaction, as we
have been reliably informed that it will take at least 
two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you. 
So we decided it is best using the email. 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Engr.Demola Fernandez, a director general in 
the Federal Ministry Of Works & Housing (FMWH)and I
head a Six-man tender board in charge of Contracts
Awards and payment Approvals. I came to know of you 
in my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very Confidential Business Transaction which
involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a
foreign account requiring maximum confidence. 

However, i and my colleagues are top officials of the
Federal Government Contract Review Panel; our duties
include evaluation,vetting, approval for payment of
contract jobs done for the Housing Ministry, etc. In
order to commence this business, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the
said funds.

The source of this funds were gotten from an
Over-Invoiced Government Contract during the last
military regime here in Nigeria. The excess of the
funds, Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars (US$12.5Million) is what my colleagues
and i have decided to transfer into a safe and
reliable account for disbursement amongst all. 

Reasons, being due to the fact that as Civil Servants, 
the laws of my country, prohibits us "Civil Servants" 
from owning foreign accounts and moreso, as members of 
this panel, we cannot do this by ourselves.
In the light of this, my colleagues and i have agreed
that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of 
this funds on our behalf, you or your company will
retain 20% of the total amount of US$12,500,000 00).

Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free,
as all documentation for success will be duly
procured, and we hope to conclude the business in
Seven (7) Bank working days from the date of receipt
of the necessary information and requirement from you
which will enable us commence this transaction fully. 

I will bring you into the complete picture of the
transaction when I have heard from you. 

Thank you and God bless.

Yours faithfully,
Engr.Demola Fernandez

Dear sir,

How I sincerely wish that this message will not amaze you and more so for the assistance that I seek from you. My name is Mr. Hanson Nyatsanza. I represent myself and Mr.Johnson Whitehead both black and white Zimbabweans.

We are first cousins on the maternal side and have been business partners for the past twenty-six years, jointly investing on farming and coffee production. We owned numerous farms and two coffee production plants in Zimbabwe, and had a work force of one hundred and eighty persons during the off-season and as much as three hundred and forty persons during the crop season. 

Over the past three years the Zimbabwean Government policies have been very unfavourable to our business and to all farmers generally in Zimbabwe which eventually culminated in the present problem. Since last year massive life threatening hostilities master minded and encouraged by the Government but executed by the National War Veterans Association was initiated against the farming community. As you may have read in the media publications, these led to the death of several farmers and their employees, including several destruction of farms, looting and outright seizure. Some farms were forcibly occupied and government took them over and re-distributed to the veterans and more so since the expiration of the deadline given by the ruling government. In the aftermath of these hostilities, three of our farms were looted and destroyed and four of our employees were killed during these inhuman occupations carried out by the veterans, with the assistance and encouragement of the Muga!
!
be government and its policy resolution. The inhuman treatment became vicious and more pronounced since he allegedly won the last election and increased since the deadline given to some farmers to relinquish their farms expired. 

Due to this very nasty life threatening experience we had and the danger of the unsafe situation, that exist in our country, we had no option but to make an arrangement to relinquish ownership of the farms to the government and negotiate for compensation. This was as far back as March of this year. It was while we were at Harare, the capital city, negotiating with the government people that tragedy struck in one of our farms. Two of the veterans that occupied our farms were murdered in mysterious circumstances. In pursuance of the hate policy of the government, instead of arresting their colleagues that occupied the farm or better still the locals living in the farm, we were located all the way in Harare and Mr. Whitehead arrested. Up till now, he has been  in police detention and all efforts to secure his bail is being frustrated by the authorities. They have since searched our homes and farms severally looking for what I cannot fathom. They even wire-tapped our telephone. Go!
!
vernment has become so desperate since after the clamping of the sanctions by the civilized world and the seizure of Mugabe assets by the British Government. Our farms have been the target of some senior officials of ZANU-PF. Towards the end of April, with the mandate of Mr. Whitehead, I negotiated and sold the farms to one of the financiers of the ruling party.  But government has decided that all the farms must be revoked as to appease those that assisted in his re-election. Before then, I have spirited the proceeds from the sale, all our monies and other  most important things in our lives to South Africa. Most importantly, we took to South Africa the sum of $15.5m in liquid cash being our life savings and proceeds from the sale of our farms with the two plants inclusive which I managed to deposit in a security company as CONTENT UNDISCLOSED BOXES. 
 
The reason why I have contacted you is due to our urgent need to get a foreign business partner, residing in a country with a favourable economic and investment climate. We have no intention of residing in Zimbabwe anymore and more so since the government and the buyer of the properties might be after us. Our fears of the inclement atmosphere in South Africa make it impossible for us to settle there also. We urgently require your assistance in receiving this amount and also be a lunch-pad for us in our quest for freedom so that we can migrate and establish a joint venture business in your country. Our preferred area of investment is farming but should you have a deviation as to what the funds should be invested into, considering profitable investment opportunities in your country, we shall have no objections.
 
Please note that if you are interested in assisting us, we will immediately arrange for the necessaries and your percentage compensation for assisting will be 12% of the total fund. 

I look forward to your immediate reply. You should reply me through these email addresses h_nya@epatra.com. I am making arrangements to acquire a safe number where we can be conversing without interruption since they have wire-tapped all our telephone lines. Please, let me have your telephone and fax numbers. 
 
Yours sincerely,
Hanson Nyatsanza.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY COMMITTEE,
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, 
LAGOS-NIGERIA.


Dear Sir,

BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$ 19.2 M (NINETEEN
MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)
& BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP.

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret as you were
introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division. and if
the contents of this mail does meet with your
approval, I humbly crave your indulgence.

I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe
(ERC) set up by the present civilian Government of
Nigeria to review economic policies of government
parastatals, and find out ways to reduce waste and
maximise revenues allocated to them.

In the course of our work at the ERC, we discovered
this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of
contracts by top government officials of the Federal
Ministry of Works & Housing (FMW&H). The company that
executed the contracts have been duly paid and the
contractscommissioned leaving the sum of US$19.2
Million lying unclaimed in the escrow account of the
Central Bank of Nigeria.

Upon interogation of the directors of engineering and
finance, who both happens to be my contemporaries in
the university, they confessed to me in confidence
that they had an agreement with the original
contractor to revaluate the original contract by 30%,
for the contractors upon request. This 30% which
amounts to USD19.2m was to be their share from the
contract, since the original contractor was well
disposed towards giving them the conventional 10%
kickback. When I now asked them what they intended to
do now that my committee has discovered this USD19.2M,
they begged me not to disclose this information to the
government as they will lose their jobs and their
family names destroyed. I was at at a crossroad, as I
did not want my friends to suffer for what other top
government officials do and get away with. I discussed
with the other two members of my committee and we all
unanimously agreed to transfer this fund out and share
amongst ourselves.

I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$19.2M
legally subcontracting the entitlement to you/your
company. This is bearing in mind that our civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning 
foreign company or running foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.

Should this transaction interest you, you are to
contact me on e-mail, so that I
can brief you fully, and discuss your renumeration for
this undertaking.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction 
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information: Your full
name/ company name, address, company's details &
activities, telephone & fax numbers.

These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned Ministries &
Agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is
going to be made in your name. Please acknowledge the
receipt of this letter using E-mail.

Yours Faithfully, 

Dr. Williams Bassey.

To: THE PRESIDENT/CEO Dear Sir, STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT. Through 
some discreet inquiries from my Chambers of Commerce, you and your
organization were 
revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship. One has no
doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business of considerable amount, which will form a
bedrock of an extensive 
business partnership in due course. In unfolding this proposal, I want to
count on you as a 
respected executive of your company to believe that you will handle it
with all maturity and 
confidentiality it deserves. I am DR MARK AKU the chairman of the Federal
Government of 
Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigerian National
Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm
by my 
committee in NNPC. This contract was over invoiced by my colleagues and
I,to the tune of US
$45.5M (forty five Million, Five Hundred Thousand united states dollars).
This was done 
deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit
from the project. We 
now desire to transfer this money, which is in a Suspense Account at the
Central Bank of 
Nigeria, to any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.
For providing the 
account where we shall remit the money, you will be entitled to 30% of the
money. 60% will be 
for me and my partners whilst 10% has been mapped out from the total sum
to cover any 
expenses/taxes that may be incurred/accrued by us during the course of
this transfer; both local 
and international. I would require from you, as a matter of urgency the
following: (1 Name of 
Beneficiary/Company Name. (2 Telephone and Fax No. of Beneficiary (3
Account No. of 
Beneficiary The above information would be used to make formal
applications as a matter of 
procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your
account. It does not matter 
whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described
here. The 
assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted
it out to other 
companies. More often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major 
contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution. We have
strong and reliable 
connections and contacts at the Apex Bank (Central Bank of Nigeria) and
the Federal Ministry 
of Finance and we have no doubt that all this money will be released and
transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when
the business is 
successfully concluded we shall, through our same connections withdraw all
documents used 
from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% security. We are
civil servants and we 
will not want to miss this opportunity. We want this money to be
transferred to the overseas 
Account for us. Please contact me immediately through my confidential
e-mail 
markaku@mail.com  or phone number 234 8033203255.
 Time is of essence in this business. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest cooperation.
 Yours faithfully, 
DR MARK AKU

>From the Desk of: DR.MRS MARIAM ABACHA 
Abacha Court, Victoria Garden City, 
Lagos-Nigeria.
Dear Sir,
I NEED YOUR HELP May the blessing of God be upon you and grant you the wisdom and sympathy to understand my situation and how much I need your help. Late Gen. 
Sanni Abacha,ex-military Head of State (Federal Republic of Nigeria) was my husband that died of heart problem. Since the death of my husband, I have been 
subjected to all sorts of harassments, intimidations and inhumane treatments,with negative reports emanating from the government and the press regarding my husband's past military regime and my eldest son Mohammed is being held.
Most of our trusted Associates betrayed us because of Ministerial Jobs and appointments. I need your immediate help, I beg of you.
I need your help to transfer what I call "our future
hope" the sum of Thirty Million United State
Dollars (US30,000,000) from my late husband's
private vault which he deposited into a security firm before his death. 
The last transfer of Ten Million United State
Dollars (US$10,000,000) I made into a friend'sforeign
account at Europe, after the successful transfer, my
friend denied me my money because of my restricted
movement within Nigeria. That is the main point why I
need your help. I lost so much trying to make transfer through some associates.
This fund is considered as the main source of my
family's future hope. When this US$30 Million dollars
is transferred, my brother Okoh Bello who is also
my close Confidant would be able to establish an
investment with your assistance on our family behalf
until I come out of my travail and tormentors. For
your information, my communication and movement are
under strict surveillance therefore make all your
communications to me through my E-MAIL ADDRESS.This is
to ensure maximum confidentiality and secret.If you HELP me receive this money 
into a foreign account, I WILL reward you with 25% of the total sum.
I will also compensate you foryour inconveniences and 10% for expenses incurred. I am depending on this fund and I am counting on you for my future and that of my 
family. I wait patiently for yourresponse.Please include your contact details ,telephone, fax and nationality.
Yours truly, 
Dr.(Mrs.)Mariam Abacha.

>Dear Sir;
>
>
>REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.
>
>I solicit your utmost confidence in this transaction. It is confidential and Top Secret. I represent officials of the Nigerian Federal Government Contract Review Panel (FGCRP) who are interested in investments, to buy and manage fish trawlers or go into crude oil exploration/marketing with funds, which are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said
>trapped funds.
>
>The source of this funds is as follows: During past military regimes in Nigeria, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced. The present Government set up a Contract Review Panel of which we are members. We have identified a lot of inflated contract funds, which are presently floating in the Apex Bank of Nigeria ready for payment. Unfortunately, as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I have been mandated by my colleagues of the panel to look for a foreign partner into whose
>account we would transfer the sum of the USD$30M (Thirty Million United States Dollars). Hence, I write requesting your unreserved assistance.
>
>
>We plan to share the money with 30% going to the Account Owner, 60% for my partners and myself and the remaining 10% used in settling all expenses.
>
>If you accept this proposal, be kind enough to send to me by fax
>
>1.     Your companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers
>2.     Your bank name, address, as well as your Bank account number.
>
>With this information, we are going to put in applications for the release of these funds into your account for us all. So far, much has been said, and due to our sensitive position we can not afford a slip in this transaction so contact me immediately through the above email address for further information on the requirements and procedures for this transaction.
>
>Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT

Dear Sir=2C

I am Mr=2E Klopper Nat=2C a Native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources=2E First and foremost=2C I apologised using this medium to reach you for a transaction=2Fbusiness of this magnitude=2C but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium=2E Be informed that your enviable credentials=2Fparticulars were given to me by a member
of the South Africa Export Promotion Council =28SEPC=29 who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition=2E I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of
the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction=2E

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the co-operation of four other top officials=2C we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totalling
Twenty - Eight Million=2C Five Hundred Thousand U=2E S=2E Dollars =28US$28=2C500=2C000=2E00=29 which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company=2Findividual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds=2E More so=2C we are handicapped in the circumstances as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction=2E

This amount =28US$28=2E5m=29 represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately=2E Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor=2C leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles got approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer =28T=2ET=29 to any foreign bank account you will provide=2E

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction=2C we will now discuss the percentage you will take to assist us in this transaction also we have set aside 5% of the total sum for taxation and miscellaneous expenses=2E The business itself is 100% safe=2C on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality=2E Also=2C your area of
specialisation is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction=2E I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me=2E Endeavour to contact me immediately through my above email adresses whether or not you are interested in this deal=2E If you are not=2C it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry
out this deal=2E

I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter=2C because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active
Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business=2E 

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation=2E Make sure that you try to reach with all the email addresses=2E

Yours faithfully=2C

Klopper Nat=2E

SOUTH AFRICA.
Tel:874 - 762864167

          (URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)
 
  (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS   
 
Dear sir,
 
We want to transfer to overseas
account($126,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and twenty
six million nited States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in
Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look for a
reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit
to provide either an existing bank account or to set
up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money,
even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as
long as you will remain honest to me till the end for
this important business trusting in you and believing 
in God that you  will never let me down either now or
in future.
 
I am Mr Henry Greay,the Auditor General of one of the
prime
banks here South Africa, during the course of our
auditing,I discovered a floating fund  in an account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has
operated on this account again, after going through
some old files in the records I discovered that the
owner of the account died without a [heir]  hence  the
money is floating and  if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The
owner of this account is Mr. Gordon G. Scott, a
foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he died,  since
1993. and  no other person knows about this account or
any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Gordon G. Scott until his death was the manager
Diamond Safari [pty]. SA.  
 
We will start the  first transfer with twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest
amount to your account. 

The amount involved is (USD 126 M) One hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is
in US dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Gordon G. Scott is a foreigner too,and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c. 
 
However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind
us together. I got your contact address  from the
Girl who operates my computer, I am revealing this to
you with believe in God that you will never let me
down in this business,you are the first and the only
person that I am contacting for this business, so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number including the full details of
the account to be used for the deposit.
 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together before transferring the money to any
account of your choice where the fund will be safe.
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing
and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine, Because the management is ready to approve
this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I 
will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are capable and will meet up with
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the money going into the  account. I will apply for
annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you
that you are ready to act and receive this fund in
your
account. I will use my position and influence to
obtain all legal approvals for  onward transfer of
this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while
5% will be for expenses both parties might have
incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
email address or tele/fax numbers.     
 
Yours truly,
Henry Greay.

Attn: 

I am Engr. Martins Tobi, Director of Project, South Africa Ministry of Mining & Natural Resources. 

I am  making this contact with you based on the committee's need for an individual/company who is willing to assist us with a solution to a money transfer. Firstand foremost, 

I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to count on you, as a respected and honest person to handle this transaction with sincerity, trust and confidentiality.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Here under for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Ministry of Mining and Natural resources where I work as Director of Project Implemention andwith the co-operation of four other top officials, wehave in our possession as overdue payment bill stotaling Twenty-one Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$21,600,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperationof a foreign company/individual to receive the saidfund on our behalf or a reliabl!
!
e foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us tooperate offshore account hence your importance in thewhole transaction.

This amount $21.6m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately.Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer(K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the  Ministry of Justice here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.I have the authority of my partners involved topropose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 20% of the$21.6 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses and while balance 5% will go to charity organisation.The business itself is 100%safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmostsecrecy and confidenti!
!
ality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. 

Endeavor to contact me immediately through my e-mail to confirm whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carryout this deal. I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment ofthis claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please, remember to treat this matter very confidential , because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service .Once again, remember that time is of great essence in this transaction.I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.


Yours faithfully,

Engr. Martins Tobi.

N.B Please email your confidential Telephone number toenable me contact you for further clarifications.

PLEASE EXERCISE SOME PATIENCE AND READ THROUGH THIS DETAILED MESSAGE 
 
I am Mr.Hammed Musa an account officer one of the Nation Bank Lagos. 
for this reason , which will come to light as you read on , I obtained your address particulars from an internet address listing .I have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you . on December 6th 1997 an oil consultant with the Nigerian National
Corporation , Mr. . Ahmed Y. Mustapha an Iraqi National, made a numbered time / fixed for 48 Calendar months, valued US$10 million in my branch . On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply After a month we sent a reminder and finally, his contract employers,the NNPC, wrote to inform us that Mr. A.Y Mustapha died in an automobile accident while travelling to
the eastern part of the country. That he died without making a WILL while all attempts to trace his KIN in Iraqi and inform them about Mr. . Mustapha ,sdeposit of US10million were fruitless. Further investigation revealed that Mr.Youseff was actively opposed to the Government of president Saddam Hussein of Iraq as a result of which
he was driven into exile. Being an oil expert, he subsequently obtained a job with NNPC, and settled in Nigeria. 
 
Thereafter, he walked into my office to make the aforementioned deposit of US$10million. He did not declare his KIN in his application paperwork. When I asked, he informed me that he wished it so. In the conservative manner of our Bank (my employer), I did not
turn down his wish but rather honored it especially given his high net worth. In reality no one knows the source of his money since apparently, the time frame of his employment with the NNPC does indeed preclude such a large amount of money. It is therefore presumed that he brought his money from Iraqi, although this is open to speculation. 

The point however is that his employers are not awareof his money, therefore one can safely infer that no one will overcome forward to claim this money. This fund, totaling US$10M is still siting in my bank dormant account portfolio. 
 
According to Nigerian law, the money will automatically revert to the federal Government Treasury after five years,especially if the account owner is a foreigner who has been certified dead and there is no valid claim. 
 
I am thus looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustapha. It is not necessary to be a blood relation,neither is it necessary to bear the same saw name with Mr.Mustapha.It is even not important for the stand in next of kin to be an Iraqi national. Already I have worked out modalities for achieving my aim of appointing a next of kin as well as transfer the
money abroad for us to share . 
 
Apparently no risk involved ! I will process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from the concern parastatal/ department. If you therefore agree to be the INHERITOR / NEXT OF KIN you should provide immediately with the following 
1. A bank Account ( an account with zero credit balance is okay . 
2. The complete name and address of the bank , 
holder/Beneficiary,your phone and fax number 
 
Once I have the required information as above, I will initiate the processing of the transfer, and in about 10 working days, the fund will be in your nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of : 70% for me and 30% for you . This transaction is guaranteed to 
succeed without any problems. And I shall forward to you more clarification you need and you are free to ask
questions 
 
Looking forward to your urgent reply 

Your truly 

Mr.Hammed Musa

                PRIVATE & STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

 

Dear sir/madam

With good recommendation,I  decided to contact you.
I am PRINCE DAVID  SAVIMBI, the son of JONAS SAVIMBI ,the leader of the
UNITA rebel in ANGOLA, who  was killed in february by the troop loyal to
the government .After his funeral  and burial,we had a family meeting and
resolved to invest the money he left  behind in your country, hence this
letter to you.He left the sum of $80 million  us dollars in cash, which was
a proceed from the sale of diamonds,which was  under his control.

However,the entire  development made us to flee ANGOLA to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH
AFRICA, for fear of  being killed.
The amount of $80 million  united states dollars in cash is presently in our
possession, and I would want it  to be invested in your country,due to the
stability of your economy.The money is  presently with an emergency
diplomatic security courier company,which my mother and I hurriedly used
to move the
cargo out from our country to SOUTH AFRICA.We  registered it under a
security
code with no name, and was registered as  containing photographic paper
material.

My mother and I have resolved to give you  15% of the total sum for your
assistance in
getting this funds transferred to  your reliable company's account in your
country,for investment.We have equally  resolved to spend the rest of our
lives in your country.You have to  make traveling arrangement
of coming to JOHANESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA,immediately to  meet with me face to
face and see the funds physically,then have it transferred  to your
account.Afterwhich both of us would travel together to your country for
sharing and immediate investment,then my family will join me later.

As we await your urgent  reply, strictly through my e-mail
 davsavimbi2002@yahoo.com , davsavimbi@hotmail.com  , 
:davsavimbi@hotmail.com or my private phone number +882 1 6466885229.  your
absolute trust and confidentiality is highly solicited to serve us better.

Best regard
PRINCE DAVID SAVIMBI

             {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)
        
   (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD  
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS )  

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Fifty two million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to 
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable  and fit to provide either an existing
bank account  or  to set up a new  Bank a/c
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in  you and believing  in God that
you  will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr Jessy Smith, the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr.  Magnus leon, a foreigner, and
a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Magnus
Leon until his death was the manager  Magnus
Coy.(pty). SA.  

We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dPOST
http://us.f203.mail.yahoo.com/ym/Compose?YY=19893
HTTP/1.0ollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Magnus Leon is a foreigner too, [and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement,  to bind us
together   I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer,  I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business,  you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address:jimsmith@hotvoice.com

Yours,
Jessy Smith.

Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. 

This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 

Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

BECAUSE OF LACK OF TRUST ON FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES,MY  FATHER HAS MANDATED ME TO LOOK FOR A TRUSTWORTHY AND  SINCERE PERSON WHO COULD HELP US COLLECT THE CONSIGNMENT FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY PENDING THE TIME WHEN ONE OF US WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVELL OUT OF THE
 COUNTRY AND JOIN YOU FOR THE SHARING OF THE FUNDS. HE HAS EQUALLY MANDATED ME TO OFFER TO YOU 20% OF THE  FUNDS  FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. ALL YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO IS TO COLLECT THE DEPOSIT DOCUMENTS FROM ME.THE  DOCUMENTS WILL ENABLE YOU COLLECT THE TRUNK BOXES
FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY BASED ABROAD ON OUR BEHALF.

THERE  IS NO RISK WHATSOVER INVOLVED AS ONLY MY FAMILY KNOW ABOUT THIS.OUR OWN SHARE IS TO BE LEFT IN YOUR CARE  UNTIL ONE OF US IS ABLE TO FIND HIS WAY OUT OF THE  COUNTRY TO OPEN NEW ACCOUNTS .IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE SEND THE FOLOWING INFORMATION.

ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO. 

URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED 

My greetings. 

I know you will be amazed to read from me, but please 
consider this letter as a request from a widow in need 
of help. 

I am Dr / Mrs. Maria Kabila, the last wife of late 
President of Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent 
Kabila. I, on behalf of Nkulo's family decided to 
solicit for assistance to transfer the sum of 
US$22,000,000.00 (Twenty-two million United States 
Dollars) to your personal account, believing that the 
funds will be saved in your bank account for my 
investment. 

This money was part of the fund secured by my late 
husband when he was still in power. As the wife he 
relied on me, my attention was drawn to this said 
amount of money in case of unforeseen circumstances. 
This fear was actualised on the 16th January 2001 when 
his bodyguard, Rasheed assassinated him. 

Please do not hesitate to contact my immediate brother 
Phillip Nkulo who is presently residing in Europe through His private email address[phillnkulo@lycos.com or phillynkulo@mail.com] For more information, because according to our culture here, I will morn my husband for 24 months. Phillip my brother will inform you of the whole procedure, because I have give authorization to deal with you on my behalf and on behalf of our family. He also has in his possession all the necessary documentation relating to the funds. 

For your assistance, we have agreed to offer you 20% 
of the total amount, while 80% will be for our 
investment in your country. 

Finally, you are requested to maintain the secrecy of 
this proposal. God bless you abunda ntly. 

Yours truly, 


Maria Kabila 
(For Nkulo's Family of Old Zaire)

CHALLENGE SECURITIES 
LAGOS NIGERIA 

The President/Ceo. 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr. Tehir Ahmed
 the Director of Operations with CHALLENGE SECURITIES
Lagos
here in Nigeria. 

Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service
to the people of Nigeria. 
I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal
that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. To be explicit and straight to the
point.  Some timeearly 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company?s
vault for safe keeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which
has accumulated a considerableamount of money in demurrage. 

Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to come and redeem the
demurrage which his consignment had accumulated we discovered that our client
was the former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, Who died of brief illness after he was de-throwed in
the same Year the consignment was enthrusted into our care. Since the death of our client
President Mobutou Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or aids had
any knowledgeof this consignent.Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly
open the two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the two
boxes that were registered as family treasure by our client actually contained a considerable
amount of money in United StatesDollars amounting to US$40million Dollar.  Since this development I have been
nursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client
siphoned a lot of money
from his country while he was in office as head of state.It is my conviction
that the consignment in our vault
was part of the money that our client siphoned and now that he is dead there is
no trace to this money
in our care. 

I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in transferring this
money out of Nigeria to your country to immediateinvestment with your assistant.
I have also decided that you will  generously be entitled to 20% of the total. Upon my receipt of your reply
confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and
transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the
complete funds to your country. 

Secondly, I will arrange for the consignment already labeled as family treasure
to be lifted by diplomatic means to our security company's correspondence in
Europe, America or in Asia where I will meet with you. You have nothing to worry about, as I will be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation. This transaction is 100% risk free. 

Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this matter. 

Thanks. 

Yours faithfully, 

Tehir Ahmed

ATTN:MD/CEO
Sir/Madam

This business proposal to you is strictly confidential, with due respect. Sorry at this perceived
confusion or stress you may have receiving this letter from me, Since we have not known ourselves or met
previously. Despite that, I am constrained to write you this letter because of the urgency of it.
I am Mrs. Paulina Madueke, the wife of late Brigadier Gen. Hippolite Madueke former ECOMOG ARMY COMMANDER [West African peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone] who died in the Sierra Leone civil disturbance [War]. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom
traditional norms. We have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's
family, simply Because I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my late husband. By tradition, all
that my late husband had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his
immediate younger brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, houses and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the
United State of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again they conspired and stole my
international passport and other traveling document to further frustrate me. Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code [KTC} from a Security & Finance Company that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million [Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars] cash with this company. It has therefore, become very necessary and urgent to contact someone, a foreigner like you to help me receive/secure this funds overseas in a reliable bank Account and to help invest it on our behalf as well, while we find a way to meet you in your country. These funds are kept with the Security Company to avoid detection/ Seizure or diversion. I have had several telephone discussions with the Assistant Director of the security company, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company's demand,
as soon as I submit a reliable Bank account for the wire transfer. This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and receive this funds on our behalf. But, you would need to give me sufficient assurance that if you help me, you will not divert the funds. My children and I have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum. This is all my children and I have got to live on. Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope
you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your private phone / mobile
Number and also your fax no for easier communication. NB: The secret codes (e.g. Pin No., Secret Access
Code) for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help me.

Stay blessed.

Mrs. Paulina Madueke.

Ibrahim Bamaiyi
Plot 1577 Otunba Davies
Victoria Island
Nigeria

I have the honour and confidence to introduce this
business to you and  I believe that we should be able
to work togther on it.

I am Ibrahim Bamaiyi, senior son of former Army chief
of Staff, LT GEN  ISHAYA BAMAYI. During the last
military regime, my father deposited the sum of
NGN400Million, which is exactly US$38Million (THIRTY
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS) in Equitorial Trust Bank Plc,
this money was lodged in cash and kept in a security
vault.

The Nigerian government released this money to the
chief of army staff  originally to be used for peace
keeping operations in war torned Sierra Leone[ECOMOG
OPERATIONS] as at November, 1998 but my father,
LT.GEN.ISHAYA BAMAIYI converted this money into his
personal use and deposited it in Equitorial Trust Bank
Plc.

However, in December 1999 the new Democratic
Government in Nigeria arrested my father for alleged
attempted murder of the Guardian Publisher, Chief Alex
Ibru and he has been in detention since that time. As
a trusted son and heir, my father has mandated me to
solicit for a trustworthy and reliable foreign partner
who can assist us to transfer this money into his
personal or company bank account for safe keeping as
the present government is bent on confiscating all my
father's  properties and investments.

Arrangement have been concluded to move this money as
consignment to Germany through diplomatic means and
this will be done as soon as you indicate your
willingness to proceed to Germany and clear it from
the courier company. This business risk free and
success guaranteed as the Nigeria  government does not
know about this money.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
twenty  percent of the total sum for your assistance,
while 10% will be used to offset expenses on both your
side and the family.

Please note that this transaction is private and
confidential and  therefore should not be discussed
with any other person until the money is confirmed in
your account. So if you are willing to transact
business with me, you should send me a reply through
my e-mail address or indicated fax or telephone
numbers. Please note that your reply must contain your
telephone and private fax numbers for easy and
confidential communication.

I believe we should be able to conclude this
transaction   within  a few days with your maximum
co-operation.

Many thanks and kind regards.

Best regards.
Ibrahim Bamaiyi

My Dear

First, it is in good faith that I open up to you and
solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction.
This is by nature of the transaction as being utterly
confidential and top secret.

I am the chairman of the Tenders Board of the
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). My
office is solely responsible for the award of all
contracts in INEC. 

I came to know of you in my private search for a
reliable foreign partner with whom to handle a very
confidential business involving the transfer from
Nigeria into a safe foreign account of a fairly large
amount totaling US$30 million. 

This fund is not connected with arms, drug or money
laundering. It is a product of a contract which my
office awarded to a foreign contractor in February
2001. Prior to the award of the contract, the
contractor had secretly met me and agreed to give me
10%($30 million) of the total contract amount in order
to award the contract to him.

The contract has since been completed and the
contractor has been duly paid off by the management of
my ministry,thus leaving the $30million in a dormant
account of a commercial bank. It is based on this that
I am specifically contacting you and seeking your
assistance to have this fund transferred into your
account because as a government worker, I dont have
all the necessary mechinaries to sucessfully acquire
this fund in my name.

Meanwhile,in order to ensure that this amount is
sucessfully paid into your account without any
suspicion, I have developed a fool proof, legal and
100% risk free scheme through which the fund can be
transferred to your account within a very short period
of 14 working days if you follow strictly my
instructions. The scheme is to use my office and
position in INEC to present you as one of the
contractors whose contract payment has been over due
for payment by my office. 

So my dear, if you are interested in this business you
are advised to kindly and urgently send to me the
following:
(1)	Name and address of your company (if any)
(2)	Your full names and addresses
(3)	Your private Tel/Fax numbers.
This information will enable me to create and open a
new contract file in your names and which I will
backdate to 2001. After i created the new file in your
name, i will then write a memo to the management of my
company to approve your file for immediate payment
since your payment has been outstanding since 2001.
 
To compensate you for your assistance and by providing
the account, I will give you 25% (7.5million) of the
total sum while 5% (1.5million) will be for the
expected over head cost and government taxes,while 70%
will be reserved for me. If you are interested, please
indicate so via a reply mail.

My regards,while thanking you for your urgent reply.

Mr Marck Peters

ATTN:CEO, 
I am Mr. John Audu, Bank Manager of Union Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On June 6, 1998, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mrs. Ann Barbara Myers made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from her contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Ann Barbara Myers died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that she died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace her next of kin were fruitless. 
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Ann Barbara Myers did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an American/Foriegner to stand in as the next of kin to Mrs. Ann Barbara Myers so that the fruits of this woman's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorneys will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys to process and notarization all the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor in order for the transfer to take place. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorneys and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. 
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: johnaudu1965@tbwt.com 
Thanks and regards. 
Mr. John Audu.

Dear,
 
 CONFIDENTIAL

I am DANIEL STEVEN KAMARA the only son of late former
Director of finance,Chief Vincent STEVEN KAMARA
Sierra-Leone diamond and mining corporation.
I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is
my bond in this my proposal. My late father diverted
this money meant for purchase of ammunition for my
country during the peak of disastrous civil war in my
country,he deposited the money with a(BANK)in Abidjan
(cote d'ivoire) where I am residing under political
asylum with my younger sister.
Now the war in my country is over with the help of
ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra
Leone has revoked the passport of all officers who
served under the former regime and now ask countries
to expel such person at the same time freeze their
account and confiscate their asset, it is on this note
that I am contacting you, all I need from you is to
furnish me with your bank particulars:
1) Account name
2) Account number
3) Bank address, telephone and fax number.
4) Personnel telepone and fax number (direct lines).
For you to assist me transfer this money in your
private bank account, the said amount is (Twenty
seven Million Dollars) $27 Million.

I will be compensating you with 10 % of the total sum,
now all my hope is banked on you and I really wants to
invest this money in your country, were their is
stability of Government, political and economic
welfare.
Honestly I want you to believe that this transaction
is real and never a joke. My late father Chief kamara
gave me the copies of the certificate of deposit
issued to him by the BANK on the date of deposit,for
you to be clarify and verification because, I do not
expose my self to anybody I see, I believe that you
are able to keep this transaction secret for me
because this money is the hope of our life, it is
important to us.

Please call me immediately after you must have gone
through my message, fill free and make it urgent. That
is the reason why I offered you 10% of the total sum
and in case of any other necessary expenses you might
incur during this transaction like your phone bills
etc.

N.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip
investment opportunities which is risk free which I
can invest with this money when it is transferred to
your account, personally I am interested in estate
management and hotel business, please advise me more.
Call me immediately you receive this message for
more explanation. And promise me and my younger sister
thatb considering our situation that you will not
betray us after the money most have reached your
account.

NB: my late father used me the only son as the
beneficiary / next of kin on the day of deposit.
Thanks and God bless

Best regards
 DANIEL S.KAMARA.

FROM:MRS. B. SESE-SEKO

I AM MRS. MARIAM SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF 
LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE?
NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
(DRC).

I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, 
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY 
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.  
I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO 
OF OUR SONS TIMOTHY AND BASHER OUT OF 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC) TO
ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY 
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED TO 
SETTLED IN MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND 
LATER DIED OF CANCER DISEASE.

HOWEVER, DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED 
TO CHANGED MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS
OF DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER
COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF MONEY CODED 
FOR SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD OF 
STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT KABILA HAS MADE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT 
AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE 
ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'STREASURES DEPOSITED 
IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE MY CHILDREN 
AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY 
THE SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND 
THE SON TAKING OVER(JOSEPH KABILA).  ONE OF MY 
LATE HUSBAND'S CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 
WAS CONFISCATED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT,
AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY SO 
THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND 
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM 
OF ONE HUNDRED  MLLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS
(US$I00,000,000,00.) WITH A SECURITY COMPANY , 
FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY 
CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING
THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST 
US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.


ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN
INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON TIMOTHY WHO IS 
WAITING FOR MY INSTRUCTIONS AND HE HAS 
KNOWS ALL MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE 
SAID FUNDS. I WANT YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING 
THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY
REVEALED. 

I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK
IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE 
IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. 
MAY  I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS,
AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU.IN CONCLUSION, 
IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON, TIMOTHY 
SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THE BUSINESS, 
TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING 
MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES 
INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 

FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH MY SON WITH
YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR 
PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER FOR 
CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT

Dear Friend donate ,

Greetings to you, sorry for the intrusion but your enviable experience in business and contacts has neccessitated this mail as i and my colleagues need your assistance , we are top government officials and currently members
of the Federal Government of Nigeria, Contract Review Panel and we need your
assistance for two things,first, to help us recieve some funds and secondly to help us invest the said funds into viable business ventures that will bring intresting returns in the immidiate future. We have benn waiting for an appropraite time to commence the deal and we feel that such a time has come, most espeacially as everyone is preoccupied with the upcoming elections.
The source of this fund is as follows: during the last government administration of
GENERAL ABDULSALAM ABUBAKAR in Nigeria, the officials
of that government set up companies and awarded themselves and their cohorts contracts which were grossly over invoiced in various ministries. As part
of its inaugural policy, the present civilian government of OLUSEGUN OBASANJO set up a Contract Review Panel, a panel in which we are members. In the
course of our investigation we identified over-invoiced contract funds US$25.5 Million which is presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria
ready for payment to any contractor with Bonafide claim. However, by virtue of our position as civil servants, we are not permitted by law to operate
foreign account. This is why we are asking for your assistance to provide the necessary documents to facilitate the transfer of this fund into any account
you will nominate . 
You shall be adequately compensated, 30% shall be yours while my colleagues
and I shall have 65%, the remaining 5% shall be for the reimbursement of any expenses that will be incurred within the duration of the transaction
This transaction is expected to be concluded within (10) bank working days on the receipt of your bank particulars, your bank name and address, account
number, name of beneficiary, telephone and fax numbers of the bank, your company name and address, telephone,fax numbers and your companys letter-headed paper. 
The above information will enable us raise a contract claim in your favour
by applying and obtaining the necessary payment approvals from the relevant authorities including the Federal Ministry of Finance (F.M.F) which shall
allocate you or your company foreign exchange cover for US$25.5million you or your company shall be officially regarded as the beneficiary of the funds.
When the money is transferred to your account, upon
confirmation from you that the fund has been credited unto your Nominated Bank Account, my colleagues and I will come over to your country for the sharing of the
funds and to work out other modalities with your assistance and guidiance for going into business in the UK and US.
Lets trust that absolute confidentiality will be our watchword throughout this business transaction. . However, your prompt reply will enable us to expedite action by forwarding the information (your bank particulars) to the
parastatals concerned for immediate processing of the document/remittance, please be informed that we have the neccessary experience and contacts to see this deal to its logical conclusion, and to assure you that its risk free because of the modalities we have worked out.

Please even if the proposal does not intrest ,i will please beg you to still keep it confidential.

Thank you and best regards.

PAT COLE

Dear Sir,

Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL. 

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you first by your
email due to the urgency of this transaction, as we
have been reliably informed that it will take at least
two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So
we decided it is best using the email. 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Engr.Sadiq Musa, a director general in the 
Federal Ministry Of Works & Housing (FMWH)and I
head a Six-man tender board in charge of Contracts
Awards and payment Approvals. I came to know of you in
my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very Confidential Business Transaction which
involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a
foreign account requiring maximum confidence. 

However, i and my colleagues are top officials of the
Federal Government Contract Review Panel; our duties
include evaluation,vetting, approval for payment of
contract jobs done for the Housing Ministry, etc. In
order to commence this business, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the
said funds.

The source of this funds were gotten from an
Over-Invoiced Government Contract during the last
military regime here in Nigeria. The excess of the
funds, Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars (US$12.5Million) is what my colleagues
and i have decided to transfer into a safe and
reliable account for disbursement amongst all. 

Reasons, being due to the fact that as Civil Servants,
the laws of my country, prohibits us "Civil Servants"
from owning foreign accounts and moreso, as members of
this panel, we cannot do this by ourselves.

In the light of this, my colleagues and i have agreed
that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of
this funds on our behalf, you or your company will
retain 20% of the total amount of US$12,500,000 00).


Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free,
as all documentation for success will be duly
procured, and we hope to conclude the business in
Seven (7) Bank working days from the date of receipt
of the necessary information and requirement from you
which will enable us commence this transaction fully. 

I will bring you into the complete picture of the
transaction when I have heard from you. 

Thank you and God bless.

Yours faithfully,
Engr.Sadiq Musa

Your receiving number, swift and routing numbers), with these informations, we can get you properly registered as one of the contractors of NNPC who has already been awarded part of this contract for the sum of US$113.4 Million to supply and install some of the Refineries plant parts which I already have in my custody. After receiving the above needed and stated information from you, we will process all the documentation and submit them for immediate approvals and the Federal Government will pay 25% of US$113.4 Million into your nominated bank account in the name of your company as the beneficiary, which isUS$28.35M .

assist us to transfer the sum of Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars ( $20,500,000 ) into his / her account.This
fund resulted by way of gratification from a contract awarded by us
under the budget allocation to my Ministry and this bill has been
approved for payment by the concerned Ministries. The contract has
since been executed, commissioned and the contractor company, paid
off.We are left with the balance of US$20.5M which was given to us by
the company for influencing the contract in their favour amidst heavy
competition from rival companies.But under our protocol division,
civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This
is why I am contacting you to be our custodian for this funds. As you
may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your contact
address over the internet, after series of intensive search. I am the Chief 
Accountant/InternalAuditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC ) of the

all sorts of RISKS and TROUBLES from any quarters whatsoever. We the

opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time
opportunity we cannot afford to miss.You need not to worry about the
responsibilities of transferring this fund into your account, for all
the administrative steps needed for the transfer of this fund into
your designated bank account will be done by me. I and my colleagues
have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us. I and one of my colleagues involved in this deal will come to
your country to arrange for our share, upon the confirmation from you
that the money has been credited into your nominated bank account.Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your interest by Telephone to me, through my Tel No:+234-80-33324030 Or Email:d_ogbe7@mail.com. Your indication
by revert Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will
enable me send you the PROCEDURE FOR OPERATION. If my line is busy,
please keep trying you will surely get through.NOTE: In the event of
your inability to handle this transaction please inform us so that we
can look for another reliable person who can assist in this
respect.It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for

Attention:Managing Director,

We write to solicit your assistance in an urgent business transaction, which we are prosecuting under condition of strict confidentiality. We got your contact through the Nigeria. Chamber of Commerce and Industries (NCC), subsequently we ran a check on your firm through Merrill Lynch international and Salomon brothers catalog. Your creditability to handle a transaction of this magnitude, which requires confidentiality, was confirmed accordingly.
We are top government officials and currently members of the Federal Government of Nigeria Senate Committee on Contact Review Panel (S.C.C.R.P). In order to commence this business, we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the sum of US$22.5M (Twenty- Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) only. The source of these fund ! is as follows: During the last Military Regime here in Nigeria the official of that Government set-up companies and awarded themselves and their cohorts, contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries. As part of its inaugural policy, the present Civilian Government set up a Senate Committee Contract Review
Panel, a panel in which we are members. In the course of our investigation, we identified a lot of over-inflated contract funds, which are presently floating in the Apex Paying Bank ready for payment to any contractors with formal genuine claim. However, by virtue of our position as public servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our name. Therefore, we require the assistance of a sincere foreign partner hence this email letter. We are interested in the transfer of the said sum of US$22.5M. We have agreed amongst ourselves to share the total funds thus:- (1) 25% for our foreign partner (you). (2) 65% for us (the officials) ! (3) 10% to be used in setting taxation and all incidental (local and foreign) expenses.
Thus, we have worked out the modalities of the prosecution of this transaction, which meet all legal and administrative requirements in our country, and those of international arbitration. We hope to conclude this transaction within seven (7) banking days and commence the transfer of funds. To enable us commence the prosecution of this transaction, we require from you the following urgently by email (1) Re-confirm weather to use your company name or your name as the beneficiary. (2) Your company address (3) Your bank name and address (4) Your
account number and account name (if any) (5) Your telephone and fax numbers or any other relevant information you may deem helpful. With the above information, we shall use your company name or your name to re-award the contract, put up letters of claim and apply for payment. Note that your account in question may need not have money in it. The! most important thing is the ability of the account to receive the incoming funds. We are looking forward to doing business with you. 
Please acknowledge the receipt of this email weather in acceptance or not to enable us to know the next step of action.

ATTN:President/CEO

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is
because
of its nature as being confidential and Top secret. I know that a
transaction
of this magnitude will make someone apprehensive and worried, but I
am assuring you that there is no cause to worry about. We have
decided
to contact you by e-mail due to the urgency of this transaction, as
we
are informed of it's swiftness and confidentiality.


Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am
Mr.SANNI
AHMED, a Manager at thecapital international bank PLC, Lagos. I came
to know
of you in my private search for a reliable and a reputable person who
can handle a confidential transaction which involves the transfer of
a huge sum of money to a foreign account .

THE PROPOSITION:

A foreigner, Engineer Johnson Creek (deceased), an Oil contractor
with
the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in
a ghastly air crash. He was a client with our bank, capital
international bank
Lagos, and had a closing balance of USD$18.M (Eighteen Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now
unquestionably
expects to be claimed by any of his available next of kin (relations)
or alternatively be donated to a war trust fund for weapon and
ammunition
at a military war college here in Nigeria.

Fervent valuable efforts had been made by the management of the Union
Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek's Family or relatives but
all this effort have proved to no avail.


I am reaching out to you because of the perceived possibility of not
being able to locate any of Engineer Johnson Creek's next of kin. (he
had no known wife and children). The management of our bank under the
influence of the Chairman, Major General Kalu Uke Kalu (Retired), had
come up with the idea to declare this fund as "NOT CLAIMED"
and this
will subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for war which will
generally
enhance further the course of war in Africa and the world.

In order to avert this negative development, myself and some other
trusted
colleagues in the Bank now seek your indulgence and permission to
declare
you as the next of kin of Late Engr. Johnson Creek. This will enable
the fund, (USD$18.5M ) to be subsequently transferred and be paid
into
your nominated Bank account as the beneficiary to the Estate of the
deceased.
All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been
carefully
worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your
share would be 30% of the total amount. 10% has been set aside for
expenses
while the rest (60%) would be for myself and my colleagues for
investment
purposes in your country.

If this proposal is in order by you and you wish to take advantage of
the trust we hope to bestow on you as the beneficiary of this fund,
then
kindly get to me immediately via telephone call intimating me with
your
most
confidential e-mail, telephone and fax numbers so that I can forward
to you the relevant details of this transaction.




Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.

Regards,
SANNI AHMED
capital international bank.
N.B. PLEASE, FOR CONFIDENTIAL REASON, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SEND MY
E-MAIL
REPLY TO :  sani1958@consultant.com

 ONLY. DO NOT SEND MAILS TO MY
OFFICE
E-MAIL.

FROM: JOHNSON VANDER
0031-625 251 889
johnsonvander3@lycos.com
 Dear Sir,
 
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am Johnson vander the first son of VanderMulaga one of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you.  Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of USD$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.
 This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the 
society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims.
 It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and recurrently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything 
we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them.
 I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I what you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds)from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands's I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then 
all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment.
 I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in 
the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above E-mail addressee, while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.
 

Thanks, GOD BLESS 
Yours Faithfully,

Johnson Vander

Urgent business

I will like to begin by way of introduction, my name is Abudu Masabela, a native of cape town, south Africa and a senior employee of the South Africa department of mining and natural resources currently here in amsterdam on a trade mission.

I am writing this letter to solicit your cooperation and participation in a business deal to redeem an investment interest currently being held under trust with the South Africa ministry of mining and natural resources. The said investment now valued at US$18,500,000.00 million was originally purchased by Mr Lucio Manfred and leased to a company the Transvaal Orange mining corporation in 1979. Since the maturity of the contract in September 1989 several attempts have been made without success to contact Mr Lucio manfred or any of his relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid.

My partner who is the accounts director at the ministry of mining and two of our colleagues have initiated the process of filling a claim for this money with the hope of having the funds transferred abroad. We request therefore that you let my partners file a claim for this money from South Africa ministry of mining and natural resources indicating that you where appointed by Mr Lucio Manfred to be the beneficiary of this funds. When the claim is approved, you as the beneficiary will be paid the sum of US$18,500,000.00 United States Dollars. Since this money will be paid directly to any bank account of your choice you are liable to ensure that my partners and I receive 75% of the total sum while you keep 25%for your services. Please we urge you to keep this matter very confidential because we are still in active public service in South Africa.

I want to assure you that my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a stong guarantee that our share will be well secured and that you will not take advantage of our position since the money will be transfered directly to your bank you are nominating.

Be rest assured that there is absolutely nothing to worry about in view of this claim. It is perfectly safe with no risks involved and it is not subject to   any enquiry since my partners will be handling it directly in South Africa on your behalf.

I do hope my proposal is acceptable to you. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter so that I can provide you with more clarification about the claim and how we intend to make this deal beneficial to everyone involved.

Please for urgent response contact me through this email address. Please send your telephone number in your response so that I can call you immediately to discuss details of the business with you.

Yours truly,

Abudu Masabela.

ATTN: Sir,

PLEASE TREAT AS ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL

My name is CYRIL BIAMBU. I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work 
for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign 
Exchange Operations (International Remittance). I am contacting you 
presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction 
that will be of immense benefit to both of us. I have the immediate need to 
transfer some money that has long been declared "UNCLAIMED" by the chairman 
and some members of the board of directors of our bank. The money is the 
closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr.Michael 
Richardson, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the 
ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria. Engr. Michael Richardson an American 
citizen was a contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, he supplied 
and installed equipment and his company Richland Contractors completed some 
of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in 
the bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$7.2Million) has been tagged 
unclaimed because no relative of Engr. Richardson has come forward to make a 
statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I 
trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that 
the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for 
themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in 
Nigeria. This invariably is an attempt to infuse more money into the 
acquisition of military equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an 
already prostrate Africa. This of course, is senseless, hence my mission. My 
colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating persons that 
could be remotely related to Engr. Richardson and we have been doing this 
for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I 
have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby 
soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be 
willing to help in this regard. We have access to most of what it will take 
to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We 
will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will 
have to answer to move the process towards completion. We will also provide 
you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You 
may however not need to make any appearance, every thing will be concluded 
on phone and fax between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] 
for your participation you will get 15%, 5% has been earmarked for the 
expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 80% shall be for my colleague 
and I. I make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you 
are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you 
receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not 
interested, then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if 
this message has upset you in any way.

Thank you and best regards.

CYRIL BIAMBU.

Dear Sir, 

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

I am an Accountant, and appointed Chairman of Contract
Review Committee with Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) set up by the Corporation in
February, 2002 to audit and review payments
offoreigncontractors in Nigeria.
 
An audit was carried out andthe sum of Forty Million
United States Dollars(US$40,000,000.00) was discovered
unclaimed,outstanding details showed that the
stated sum resulted from deliberate over-valuation
and over-invoicing of an oil exploration
(SEISMIC)contract awarded to a foreign firm which has
been paid the exact job value.

Sequel to an order by the Managing Director, Nigeria
Petroleum Corporation to retire all debt owed to
foreign contractors before the end of this quarter ,
informed the Managing Director of the discovered fund
and we agreed that the money should be remitted
overseas immediately taking cognisance of the
economy,and our future prospect since we will beduefor
retirement soon. 

We wish to take this opportunity to put claims on
behalf of your company or person and transfer  into
your account in other to achieve this as soon as
possible, we shall require these data from you
byE-mail.

Your Bank Account Number, Name of Bank,
Address, Telephone and Fax Number of your Bank to
process documents and remit the money
bytelegraphictransfer.

Payment of this money has been approved and
modalities for a successful remittance have beenworked
out.However, I will be most obliged by an assurance
from you that you will not sit on the money
whentransferred into your account.

Moreover,confidentiality of this exercise
is imperative because it will deprive me and others of
our pension and benefits. Meanwhile, we have agreed to
give you 30% of the sum for using your account , while
5% will be used to repay all incidental expenses
incurred in the course of this transaction. 

The remaining 65% is for the Managing Director and
thoseof us (NNPC STAFF)that are involved. Your
assistance is highly solicited. Contact me through the
E-mail number as soon as possible if you are pleased
with the offer.

Best regards,
Elendu John

DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES 
PLOT 225 KOFO ABAYOMI STREET VICTORIA ISLAND,LAGOS, NIGERIA.
DIRECT TEL/FAX: 234 1 759 4484
ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
RE: URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear Sir,

I am DR JAMES OTELEMATE,member committee of the above department
Terms of Reference
My term of reference involves the award of contracts to multinational companies.
My office is saddled with the responsibility of contract award, screening, categorization and prioritization of projects embarked upon by Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as well as feasibility studies for selected projects and supervising the project consultants involved. A breakdown of the fiscal expenditure by this office as at the end of last fiscal quarter of 2000 indicates that DPR paid out a whooping sum of US$736M(Seven Hundred And Thirty Six Million, United States Dollars) to successful contract beneficiaries. The DPR is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid for the third Quarter of 2002.
The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the DPR deliberately over invoiced the contract value of the various contracts awarded. In the course of disbursements, this department has been able to accumulate the sum of US$38.2M(Thirty-eight Million, two hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) as the over-invoiced sum. This money is currently in a suspense account of the DPR account with the Debt Reconciliation Committee (DRC). We now seek to process the transfer of this fund officially as contract payment to you as a foreign contractor, who will be fronting for us as the beneficiary of the fund. In this way we can facilitate these funds into your nominated account for possible investment abroad. We are not allowed as a matter of government policy to operate any foreign account to transfer this fund into.
However, for your involvement in assisting us with this transfer into your nominated account we have evolved a sharing formula as follows:
(1) 20% for you as the foreign partner
(2) 75% for I and my colleagues

(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both Locally and Internationally during the course of this transaction.

We shall be relying on your advice as regard investment of our share in any business in your country. Be informed that this business is genuine and 100% safe considering the high-power government officials involved. Send your private fax/telephone numbers. Upon your response we shall provide you with further information on the procedures. Feel free to send response by Fax or TEL; expecting your response urgently. All enquiries should be directed to the undersigned by FAX OR PHONE.
Looking forward to a good business relationship with you.

Sincerely,
DR JAMES OTELEMATE.

 Dear Sir/Madam,


With a sincere heart, I write you this proposal in
utmost confidentiality, trust and wish to draw your
attention to my need for assistance.

I am a wife of late DR Nzamba Leonba, who died after
three days Major-Operation at General hospital Nkembo
Libreville Gabon.

He was a Computer scientist with the Banque des Etats
de l'Afrique centrale Gabon branch.

I got to know of your courtesy of international
business bureau, from Gabon business/weekly
publication.

Sequent to my zeal towards the security of my life and
my husband fund in Foreign Security Firm in Gabon. I
therefore write to give you break down of my life.

My dear, I have two happy days. Happy days are what we
worked for. But happy days are not easily worked for.
(tears) my late husband left me without a child.
Besides, I was made to understood that, if a man died
without an issue all his wealth will be shared by the
entire relatives.

>From the time immemorial, the tendency of human beings
is live to live together, very few normal human beings
live in isolation from their kind. Therefore
consciousness of kind leads to Community living with
it's own ethos and taboos.

Precisely, my husband had a secret Account Worth of
$21.8 Million(TWENTY-ONE MILLION EIGHT HURNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS) with the Foreign Security Firm, which I now demanded your ability/assistance to put up claims of receiving the fund on your side for safety. Since the money has to be claimed by a non connaissance.

Dear, I'm down with imperialism and tribal division,
no sporadical act nor pious revolution can resolve my
present problems and condition. Nothing will be of
avail except one from overseas assisted me and claim
this fund through the help of my husband Arttorney in
NIGERIA who is presently representing his clint in federal high cort of nigeria..

For now I am lame and I must depend on crutches to
support and sustain myself. But tomorrow may be well
on the way. Flying low or high in life depends in
Ahla.
My humble duty now is to pray that my wound shall be
healed if ever you will never fail me in the long days and longer nights.
30% of the money will goes to you.
20% for my ATTORNEY,while 40% will belong to me.
10% will be set aside for any expencess that will be encounter during the time of this transaction.

I await your kind response.
Yours sincerely,
MRS LINDA LEONBA

Sir,

RE : BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP.

It is indeed a delight to have your contact and the privilege of introducing 
my self to you. I therefore write to inform you that I am FREDINARD MUSA 
Esq., 63 years old civil-servant and the incumbent Director General of 
senegales Security Printing and Minting Company. The reason for this 
correspondence is to formally request for mutual business partnership with 
you in order to benefit from your wealth of experience in business and 
possibly invest in your company under your professional guidance.

The secret fact therefore, is that I have the sum of US$13,200,000.00 CASH 
in one of the SECURITY AND FINANCE COMPANY IN NETHERLANDS. The money is the 
share of proceeds from a deal executed with my colleagues in the hierarchy 
of MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMIC PLANNING during a contract award to an 
Ukrainian Diamond and Gold Extracting Company late last year .
Due to my status as a civil  servant and the sensitivity of my position 
that attracts public attention, I cannot operate a domiciliary account in 
order to keep this large sum of money in a bank account in my country as a 
civil servant. Again, I have been suffering from heart disease for years now 
and the situation seems to be deteriorating, In fact, my doctor told me that 
I have very short time to live. Base on this ,I decided to hasten to secure 
this money and invest it for my children before I could write my WILL to 
avoid problems when I might have gone because I have three wives with many 
children.

Right now, I have sent one of my son whom I trust to Netherlands to arrange 
for the release of this money from security company with assistance of 
foreign partner who will assist us to claim ,safe guard and in area of 
investment in your country.

Upon your indicated interest, I will arrange for a meeting at Netherlands 
with my son to discuss the details of this proposal and terms of agreement. 
I will be glad to complete this partnership venture with you in earnest.
Please include your private Telephone / Fax numbers in your reply for easy 
communication. I earnestly await your urgent response as I expect you to 
treat this matter with required maturity, attention and seriousness it 
deserves.

Best Regards FREDINARD MUSA  Esq.

(Bsc. Msc.ICA. Member Inst. Econs./ strategic  studies)

NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES.
LAGOS HEADQUARTERS.

     TELE GRAM  NNPC-DPR
     OFFICE THE AUDITOR GENERAL
    OF NNPC.FROM THE DESK OF: CHINAC DONALD
     
    

ATTN: 
A CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Compliment of the day to you, I wish to extend this mutual business proposal to you with the hope that you will gladly accept, I am the principal Auditor of the Nigeria National petroleum corporation,  Post I have held for the past three years, in the course of discharging my duty last year, I discovered that some government officials in the past, committed some irregularities in the form of over-invoiced contract values which eventually go into their private bank account.

What interest me most for which reason I am writing you is this particular contract which was awarded to a foreign contractor, it was over estimated by the tune of US$28.8M (Twenty Eight Million, Eight Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars). This contract has been completed and commissioned and the contractor fully paid, but the US$28.8m over estimated value of the contract is still lying  at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as debt which NNPC is owning to foreign contractor but there is no body to make claim on it.

But  since I stormed into the huge some of money as an auditor, it is right now under my care with the assistance of CBN Governor. As a civil Servant in the Federal Parasital 
It is very dangerous for me to lodge this sum of money into my private account, rather I am looking forward for a possible transfer of the money into a private  foreign account, and if you will assist me in facilitating the transfer of this fund into your account under 14 banking working days, out of Nigeria you will be entitled to 40% of the money. For your assistance and co-operation. 50% will be for the officials concerned in the deal. 10% will be mapped out for both local and international expenses that will involve during the transaction. So if you have the capacity to assist me please proceed by sending the following informations, the name and address of your bank the fax and the telephone numbers for bank to bank communication, Four perform invoice and your company letter headed paper which will enable us lay claims on this money. If this proposal suits you as I hope it should.
please do not hesitate to contact me via the above email addresss or chinaecherem@yahoo.com


Yours faithfully,
CHINAC DONALD
OFFICE THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF NNPC.

dear sir;

 

In order to transfer out (USD 126 M) One hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars) from Afican Development Bank. I have the courage to ask you to look for a reliable and honest person who will be
capable for this important business believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am MRS ZUMA Manto,the Chief auditor of African Development Bank (ADB).There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out
urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Smith B.Andreas, a foreigner,and a miner at kruger gold co., a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is ((USD 126M) One hundred and twentysix million United States Dollars million dollars.

I want to first transfer USDM twenty six millionunited States Dollars from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner? I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can
only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the account is Mr. Smith B.Andreas he is a foreigner too.

I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don't know ourselves before. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business.I only got your contact address from my secretary
who operates computer, with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business. You are the only person that I have contacted in this business; so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund will be safe' And I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investments.

I am contacting you because of the need to infrom foreigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make
this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you later immediately, if you are able and with capability
to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutualbenefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need truthful person in this business
because I don't want to make mistake I need your strong assurance and trust.

With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for
sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place. You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in
your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply. or by my
Tell

Yours truly,
MRS.  ZUMA Manto

Good day.SIR,

     Following the sudden death of my husband General
Sani Abacha the late  former head of state of Nigeria
in June 1998,I have  been thrown into  state of utter
confusion, frustration and  hopelessness by the
present   civilian administration, I have been
subjected to  physical and psychological  torture by
the security agents in the country.

     My son is still under detention arraigned
before the federal high court   of Nigeria for an
offernce he did not commit.

     You must have heard over the media reports and
the  internet on the   recovery   of various huge sums
of money deposited by my  husband in different
security   firms abroad, some companies willingly give
up their  secrets and disclosed  our money confidently
lodged there or many outrightly  blackmail us. In fact
the total sum discovered by the Government so far  is
in the tune of   $700   Million dollars. And they are
not relenting to make   me poor for life.

          I got your contacts through my personal
research,and out of desperation   decided to reach
you through this medium.  I repose   great confidence
in    you hence my approach to you. Due to security
network   placed on my day   to day affairs I cannot
afford to visit the embassy   so that is why    I
decided to contact you and I have the sum of   $18
million USD with   a      security firm abroad whose
name is witheld for now   until we open communication.

     I shall be grateful if you could receive this
fund   into your account  for safe keeping. This
arrangement is known to you  and my son Mustapha
alone, so my son will deal directly with you as
security is up my whole    being. I am seriously
considering to settle down   abroad in a friendly
atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund get into
your account so   that    I can start all over again.

        Please  honesty is the watch word in this
transaction.    I will require your telephone and fax
numbers so  that we can  communicate    immediately
and I will give you  more details and the full
picture of things. In case you dont accept please do
not let me out to  the security   as I am giving you
this information in total trust  and confidence,  I
will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal   in
good faith.Please expedite action.

  Sincerely yours

MARIAM ABACHA

World's Smallest Radio-Control Car!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The smallest, zippiest radio-controlled car there is! 
These Turbo radio-controlled cars recharges from 
portable battery-powered base in only half a minute 
and are ready for fun! Complete push-button controls 
backward, forward, right and left turns let you race 
through any maneuver.

Telescoping antenna and compact base make it easy to 
carry all components in their own see-through cylinder. 
Different colored units operate on different frequencies, 
so that you can race with a friend!

Sale Price: $9.99 Find out more.... >> http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=ejesetn6.yufstde6.kvkretn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ekitchengadgets.com%2Fworssmalradc.html

The all-new Mini RC Racer - Get Yours Now
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The car itself is so small, that it won't fit any batteries -
 so it has a rechargeable NiMh battery under the 
bonnet! 

The miniature size hasn't compromised features though -
 the tiny engine runs at an incredible 10,000 RPM, 
empowering these cars to go FAST! 

Thankfully those clever designers included full 6 point 
steering system - providing the ultimate combination of 
speed and control.

With three different frequencies to choose from, you 
can race against two mates at the same time.

Sale Price: $9.99 >> http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=ejesetn6.yufstde6.kvkretn6&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ekitchengadgets.com%2Fworssmalradc.html

I am sending this missive to my e-mail list.  It is a blatant attempt to
talk you into going to the polls and voting YES for Proposition 46, the
Emergency Shelter and Housing Trust Fund Act of 2002, on November 5.
Or, better yet, vote absentee now so you can be sure that your vote will
get there.  If you don't know about where you polling place is located,
the Secretary of State's Web site can help you find it.  There is also
information about how to vote absentee, and you can get a copy of the
State Voter Pamphlet there, in case you haven't gotten yours or have
misplaced it.   >http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/elections.htm<

So, if you have already voted, you can just delete this message.  And,
if you are already sure you will vote YES on Proposition 46, you don't
need to read this either.  Feel free to pass it along if you like, and
thanks for your support.  However, if you haven't voted and haven't made
up your mind, read on.

California is in a Housing Crisis.  You have probably read several
articles in your local newspapers about the dimensions of the housing
crisis in your area.  Most of them tell the story from one particular
point of view.  But, whether the issue is the increase in the number of
homeless families showing up at shelters or the inability of middle
income working families to buy a home, seniors being evicted when their
subsidized apartments are converted to market rents or college students
not being able to afford tuition, books and rent, the problem is
pervasive and getting worse daily.

California's Housing Crisis has been building for a decade or more, and
it is affecting people at almost all income levels and in all parts of
the state.  Clearly, the urban and coastal areas, where most
Californians live, is suffering the most, but the negative effects are
spilling over into the Great Valley and our rural areas.  Proposition 46
is not a cure-all, but it is a good downpayment and a first step toward
addressing this crisis.

California has one of the lowest homeownership rates in the nation,
housing costs are escalating beyond the reach of working families (and
much faster than inflation), too few homes are being built to
accommodate the new jobs our economy is producing, seniors and families
are at risk of homelessness, battered spouses and their children are
being turned away from shelters because there aren't enough beds to go
around, and the farmworkers who support the third largest sector of
California's economy (to say nothing of providing us with all those
fresh fruits, veggies and cheese) have to live in squalor and
overcrowded conditions.  How did this happen?

It is a long story, but there are three themes that run through it:  (1)
Not enough housing is being built; (2) the housing that is available
costs more than the jobs our economy is creating can afford to pay; and
(3) there are not enough public resources being invested in housing to
redress the imbalance.  Proposition 46 will address that last point, and
that will help us address the first one.  And, the jobs that will be
created in building the new housing are good paying ones that will help
those workers afford better homes.

Proposition 46 will allocate $2.1 billion to the creation of new housing
opportunities for a wide range of people.  Proposition 46 is a General
Obligation Bond, which means it will NOT raise taxes.  General
Obligation (GO) Bonds are a form of borrowing (like a loan) that is
secured by the good faith and credit of the state of California, the
sixth or seventh largest economy in the world.  What happens is, the
state will sell the bonds to investors who want a tax exempt income.
The bonds are like mortgages  they are promises to pay the lender (bond
buyer) back over 30 years, with interest, much like the promissory note
on a home purchase is a promise by the homebuyer to repay the lender.
Since interest rates are at their lowest levels in decades, the amount
that will have to be repaid is also lower.  That money will then be
invested in housing.

Of the $2.1 billion, over half will go to developing rental housing to
serve the needs of working families who cannot afford rising rents, and
to preserve existing affordable housing where the tenants are at risk of
being evicted because they cannot pay market rents, as well as develop
housing to support the health and social service needs of the disabled
and to help modify housing to accommodate those with mobility
impairments. There is also money, on a matching basis, to assist local
housing trust funds in their efforts to address local housing needs and
to develop new housing for low-income students at California's
universities.

Over $400 million is allocated to assist families become homeowners,
including commitments to self-help housing efforts, like Habitat for
Humanity, low interest loans to help low- and moderate-income families
buy their first homes, and to assist school personnel to live in the
communities where they teach.  $200 million is set aside to help develop
housing for the state's farmworkers, including funds for health
services.

And, $195 million is specifically designated to help develop more
shelters for the increasing numbers of homeless our economy is
creating.  These funds will help create more shelter beds so that
families, especially victims of spousal abuse and families with
children, will not be turned away from overcrowded emergency housing.

How did we get here?  It is a long story  really about 15 years long.
California has been growing at a rapid rate, with population increasing
at over 400,000 per year, forming over 110,000 new households each year,
between 1990 and 2000, we needed to create a lot of housing.  Why did
all of those people move to California in the 1990s?  Because our
economy added over 190,000 new jobs between 1990 and 2000, and jobs
attract employees to fill them.

But, while this tremendous growth was occurring in California, we didn't
build enough housing to accommodate those who moved here, and our own
children growing up and forming their own families.  During the 1990s,
California added a little over 100,000 new units a year.  That is less
than one new place to live for every 4 persons added to our population,
and about 10% less than we needed to house the newly formed households.
We added new housing about half as fast as we added new jobs.

What that means is, we now have a housing shortage.  And it is getting
worse every year.  It is estimated that we now have a shortfall of over
one-quarter of a million homes needed to accommodate our existing
population, and we will have to add on average 220,000 a year between
now and 2020 to keep pace with our projected future growth in
households, most of whom will be our own children growing up and forming
their own families.

What does a housing shortage mean?  The old supply and demand market
we are used to hearing about is still in effect.  When are more renters
and prospective homebuyers than there are homes to rent and buy, the
market adjusts by raising the prices until the supply and demand come
back into balance.  And that is what we have seen in California  rents
and home prices have gone up, fast.  However, the usual market
adjustment of adding more supply to balance out the demand has not
worked in housing, for many reasons.

Since the supply has not increased, the other response to rising prices
is taking effect  the consumers of housing are buying less of it.
Housing is different from other goods and services, though.  When
families consume less housing, that means they are either doubling up
or living in overcrowded conditions, or, in extreme cases, going without
housing  becoming homeless.

Why can't we pay more for housing?  Since California is adding so many
new jobs, you would think that all those new workers would have enough
money to pay for more housing units.  The sad truth is that the incomes
of our fastest growing jobs are not enough to pay for even moderately
priced housing.  Median family incomes in California only rose about
3.8% per year in the 1990s.  Considering that the average Cost of Living
in California only went up by about 2.9% per year in the 1990s, that is
pretty good.  However, rental prices have been increasing much faster
than that, and the sale price of homes has been going up as much as 20%
per year!

The disparity between rising housing costs and slower increases in
income is not evenly distributed.  While homeowners showed an increase
in their incomes, renters actually had a net decrease in their incomes
between 1989 and 1999 when adjusted for inflation, and renters with
children and poor renters had the biggest declines, or 11% and 13.6%
respectively.  And, this isn't going to get better soon.  Of the ten
fastest growing jobs in California, five pay average wages of less than
$10 per hour and only three pay more than $30 per hour.  That means that
most of the new employees hired will not earn enough to afford an
average apartment in our cities.  And even fewer will be able to become
homeowners, even after years of work.

The result is that more and more people are being priced out of the
housing market.  That has led to an increase in the number of households
living in overcrowded housing or in substandard units.  The rate of
homeownership in California is about 56%, already far below the national
average of 67%, and it is dropping for all groups except seniors.

The only way the new workers California needs, and the workers who are
already here, will be able to afford decent, affordable housing, is for
more housing to be built at lower prices.  And that requires subsidies.
If our economy is to remain strong, the businesses we want to locate
here will have to be able to recruit and keep employees who can afford
to live here.  Public subsidy comes in three forms:  (1) direct payments
to households to assist in their payment of rent or mortgages, (2)
grants or below market interest rate loans to developers of housing, and
(3) tax breaks.

Almost all tax breaks go to those who already have become homeowners
through the mortgage interest deduction.  In California, nearly $3
billion in housing subsidy was provided to homeowners through the
mortgage interest deduction in the 1990s.  Preferential treatment of
capital gains on home sales and property tax exemptions provided another
$1.4 billion in subsidy to homeowners.  By contrast, the one tax benefit
provided to renters, who make up nearly 45% of the families in
California, added up to about $140 million, less than three percent of
the amount of subsidy provided to homeowners!  And the renters tax
credit was suspended from 1993 to 1997.

Direct subsidies to tenants and developers has also been very low for
the last decade compared with other states.  In 2001, State Legislature
allocated about $650 million to housing, the largest amount ever
dedicated to housing development in dollars.  However, that was only
about 0.6% of the State Budget.  In 1990, the Legislature allocated 0.7%
of the State Budget to housing, but in the rest of the decade, the
average allocation of funds to housing programs was 0.2% of the State
Budget.  Almost every other state with a large urban population
allocated much more than California, which may be one of the reasons
those states are not facing a housing crisis today.

Proposition 46 is a downpayment to start us on the track to addressing
the housing crisis we are facing.  You have probably heard all the
arguments in favor of it:

   * We need the housing, especially for the most needy who are being
     hurt the most.
   * Now is the best time to borrow money for housing, interest rates
     have not been this low for decades and may not be this low again.
     (Why do you think everyone you know is refinancing their homes?)
   * The money provided by Proposition 46 will leverage other
     investment, up to $13 billion, in housing development, and will
     allow the residents who move into affordable homes to spend their
     incomes on other goods and services, estimated as another $24
     billion.
   * The housing development and other activities will generate over
     one-quarter of a million new jobs for our economy, and housing has
     traditionally been a leader in bringing our economy out of the
     doldrums.
   * These funds will help 65,000 families become homeowners, and create
     over 27,000 new permanently affordable apartments, as well as
     providing funds for emergency shelters and housing for farmworkers.
   * And, 65% of the money provided by Proposition 46 will in loaned to,
     and repaid by, the developers and residents who benefit.  In
     addition, there are provisions to make sure that the money is
     managed correctly, with annual audits, and that any funds not used
     for one purpose is reallocated to other programs that can use it.

So, vote YES for Proposition 46, and tell your relatives, friends,
coworkers and neighbors to vote YES too!

Dear Partner,
I have a business proposal which I know might interest you. I have in my posession a large sum of money which I want to invest in your country. In introduction, my name is Mrs.Wetego Fatou Sankoh, a Sierra Leone and the wife of Corporal FODAY SANKOH, who is the leader of the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone (RUF) and formerly the Director of GOLD AND DIAMOND CORPORATION of Serria Leone. My Husband was arrested and is presently being detained by the Civilian Government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, for the role he played during the regime of Major Paul Koromah, which resulted to war. 
On the night of my Husband's arrest , he instructed me to move out the country without delay, with total sum of $US40Million which is contained in a sealed trunk box, including quantities of Gold Dust and some uncut Diamonds. I fled out of our country in the company of my children through costal river and arrived in Abidjan(Ivory Coast), where I deposited the trunk box in a security company as containing family treasure for safe keeping. I have interest in your country and would want to go into partnership venture with your company. I am asking for your assistance to help us move out the money and secure it for onward investment and to make residence arrangement for us. 
I have the consent of my family and we have agreed to give you 15% of the total amount as compesation and share for your concern and assistance you may render in the transaction, including 10% share from the profits which the money will generate in future from investment. The existence of this fortune which I have revealed to you is authentic and confidential and there is no risk involved in the cause of retreiving back the deposited trunk from Security Company. 
The consignment has been transfered from Africa based on my new instruction and it is currently in the custody of the Security Company's Feduciary Agent in Madrid however, I decided to travel over to Madrid - Spain under a Refugee Status in search of a good friend of my Husband who leaves in the city, I have arrived here only to witness that the man has relocated to somewhere else. It is for this reason that I am contacting you so you should please not feel embarrased receiving this mail from me. I am in Spain with my children and may leave back to Africa should I not hear from you, in order to facilitate another arrangement, but for now you should kindly reach me through the phone at +34-6699 32341 or via email, to enable me give you further details and also to fax you all relevant documents covering the deposit of the trunk box. 
My Husband is still in detention and may finally face public execution, hence we have considered it very unsafe to remain in Africa as we may be the Gorvenment next target. Accept my sincere regards while hoping to hear from you. 
God Bless. 
Best Regards, 
MRS.WETEGO  SANKOH.

Bernard Eze 
First City Merchant Bank Limited 
Lagos - Nigeria. 

Dear Sir, 

                MUTUAL BUSINESS CO-OPERATION 

I am Mr. Bernard Eze, the manager Bills and Exchange First City Merchant Bank Limited. I am writing this letter to ask your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. 

My colleagues and I discovered an abandoned sum of US$22 million (Twenty Two Million United States Dollars) in a fixed deposit account that belong to one of our foreign customers, who registered with (NNPC) as oil merchandise and contractor during the past military rule of General Sani Abacha, and died in November 1998 in a ghastly 
motor accident. 

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither their family members nor distant 
relatives have ever appeared to claim the said funds. Upon this discovery, other Officials in my department and I, have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the funds will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed funds after 4 years. 

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus; 20 % for you as foreign partner, 75% for us the officials in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by you and us during the course of this business. 

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, one of my colleagues and I will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75% we intend to invest in a viable sector in your country since we cannot bring back the money to my country. 

To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number, full name and address and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file letters of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer 
can be made. Note also, that this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. 

I look forward to receiving your prompt response. 

Best regards, 

Bernard Eze 
First City Merchant Bank Limited.

to you as a surprise because we have not met before
either physically or through correspondence. I got
your contact from our chamber of commerce here in
Nigeria and have no doubt in your ability to handle
this proposal involving huge sum of money.
My private Email address is as above.

THE SUBJECT: My father ALHAJI MUSA ABACHA (Now Late)

town) in Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the
total crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the
Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my father as
royalty by the Federal Government.

My father was also the Chairman of ELEME Special Oil
Trust Fund. In his position as the Royal head and
Chairman of the Oil Trust Fund, he made some money
which he left for me
as the only heir to inherit.The money is Ten Million
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars($10.5m).
This Money originated from the accumulated royalties
between 1976-1998 . Due to poor banking system in
Nigeria and political instability as a result of past
Military rules (1985-1999) , he deposited this Money
in a Strong Room/"VAULTS" with an open beneficiary in
Apex Bank of Nigeria pending when he would finish
arrangement to transfer it abroad as a CONTRACT
PAYMENT. He was planning this when he died late last
year of Heart attack.

THE PROPOSAL: Just before my father died he called my
attention to the money and charged me to look for a
foreigner who would assist me in the
transfer/investment of the funds abroad. So l would
be very grateful if you could accept to help me
achieve this great objective. I promise to give you
20% of the total funds transferred to your vital bank
account as compensation for your assistance. ten
percent (10%)would be set aside to take care of all
expenses we may incure during the transaction. If you
indicate your interest, contact me urgently and
confidentially through my e-mail address above for
more information and the roles you will play in this
business.

All the legal Documents concerning this Money will be
sent to you as soon as we agreed together.
To indicate your interest in this transaction kindly send your
the informations.your private phone fax number were i can reach you.

Dear Sir,

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE

I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed
properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and
Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in my
country.

Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would
want the transaction to be strictly confidential as possible. He
further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now,
until the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an
overseas agent. I have therefore been directed to inquire if you
would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualize this
transaction.

The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry
out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded
Escrow account of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing. We need
your assistance to transfer the funds to your country in a convenient
bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds
into use in your country. For this, you shall be considered to have
executed a contract for the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in
Nigeria for which payment should be effected to you by the Ministry.
The contract sum of which shall run into US$31.5 Million, of which
your share shall be 20% if you agree to be our overseas agent.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is
successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use our own
share in acquiring some estates abroad. You shall also serve as our
agent. In the light of this, I would like you to forward to me the
following information:


	(1)Your company name and address
                (2)Your Banking  Information
  	(3)Your personal fax number
  	(4)Your personal telephone number for easy communication.


You are requested to communicate your acceptance of this proposal
through my above stated email addresse, after which we shall discuss
in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through.
Your quick response will be highly appreciated.

Thank you in anticipation of your cooperation.

Yours faithfull
MR. KOFI DAN.

Hello,

My name is Martin and I am graduate from Warsaw School of Economics (Poland). 
My major is Finance and Banking. I wish to research some more on the issue concerning 
the financial aid one can obtain while studying in the Unites States. I am particularly 
interested in an MBA education at one of the Universities. I assume I need to 
provide you with some personal data so that You could assess any risk in connection 
with granting any kind of financial help.

Going into details :
I am male 25 (white) 
Citizen of Poland,
I am not decided yet which university I will choose. Currently working on GMAT 
and TOEFL. 
I have 2 years worth of work experience in distribution company (Cisco, 3Com, 
USR, APC and Palm products) on as position of a credit controller. On request 
I will provide you with my CV.

Please tell me what the chances are for me (as a foreigner) to obtain any kind 
of financial aid. Does every foreigner need a co-signer and what is the percentage 
of students from abroad that receive such help?

Thanks in advance for any kind of assistance in this matter

Yours sincerely,

Martin

Hi, 

I have visited your web site at: http://promo.net/pg/

My name is Benjamin Souque and I appreciate the content and design quality. 

Because of that I want to send you a paycheck. 

This is called a joint venture. 

We are both in the "web traffic" industry, therefore your subscribers may be interested in my web site. 

My sale letter is so good that 1 out of 10 subscribers normally buy. 

My secrets on how to get 1 million visitors without paying a dime in advertisement are presently sweeping the web like a raging fire! This info page has suddenly been taken by assault from visitors getting in and in and in! 

And I'm splitting the profits with you. Simply put a link on your homepage and post a little 5-line text ad in your next newsletter to all of your subscribers and you get 50% of the profits. Simple as that. You get almost $45 per sale. 

In other words, for each 1000 readers you have, you should make $300 to $500. That is because your readers and visitors are highly targeted. 

You only need to post my little 5-line text ad and Voila! 

The best part is that my secrets about FREE WEB TRAFFIC are so good that your affiliates will send you much more traffic on your site and you will continue to make more sales after that! 

But you must act now! It is very simple, but if you don't know how to do this, I will explain it step-by-step. It's very simple; you are only 3 steps away from making several hundred dollars. 

Simply reply to this email with "Reply Join" in the subject field for the 3-step instructions. 

Or write to me personally at benjamin.souque@netcourrier.com 

Best regards, 

Benjamin Souque,

Dear :Sir

I am Ustas Campbell, an Engineer with the federal ministry of petroleum
resources,
I got your contact through a friend whom I told I needed an assistance on
some information,
although I did not disclose the natureof business to him, since it demands
absolute secrecy.

The Tiny republic of Benin a country in west Africa discovered crude oil,
black gold in Portnovo and since they're not members of organization of
Petroleum Exporting 
Country (OPEC)
they requested for our assistance through our ministry whose subsidiary is
the NNPC, 
we were able to assist in drilling and excavation of this black gold and
also spot lifting. 

As a result of the spot lifting an excess of $48.5million US dollars was
recorded and itis in 
ourfavor
my colleagues then decided we should look for an honest and sincere person
who could claim 
responsibility 
of this amount because the law of our country does not allow civil
servants to operate
foreign account,talk less of owing one.

Presently the money is safely kept in an escrow account secure from alleyes.
We shall be meeting with you if you accept to assist us, secondly it would
also afford us to 
know what percentage that
will be given to you,for your assistance. It will take seven working days
to actualize this project 
and safely transfer 
into your>bank account on our behalf and yourself. 

I will appreciate your quick response through my email
I am open to further question you may wish to ask in respect of this
business transaction.

 Sincerely yours,


Ustas Campbell
my phone is:00229-015389

Sir,

                                     URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

Firstly, I have to introduce myself to you. My name is Dr Wilfred Mboyo 
from Zimbabwe. I 
was the chairman of contract review panel in my country before the 
problem of the land 
reform program.
Before the escalation of the situation in Zimbabwe I recovered 
$16.8Million US dollars from 
over inflated contracts by some government officials. But I was a member 
of the opposition 
party the MDC(Movement for Democratic Change), and the ruling Party, 
(ZANU PF) has 
been against us. So I had to flee the country for a neighbouring African 
Country which I am 
currently residing.

Before the escalation of the situation in Zimbabwe I had not reported The 
recovery of my 
findings to the panel. So this money was in my possession and I lodged it 
in a security 
company here in Africa and currently this money has been moved to their 
security branch in 
Europe. I have been trying to fly to Europe but it has been difficult  for me 
to get a visa from 
Africa. So I want you to help me make claims of this fund($16.8m) in 
Europe as my 
beneficiary and transfer the money to your account or any account of 
your choice before I 
can get a visa to fly down. So that we can share this money.

I have agreed to give you 10%,which would be ($1.6Million dollars) of this 
Money for your 
assistance, and 85% would be mine and the other 5% would be set aside 
for any expenses 
that we may incure during the course of this transaction. And my 85% 
would be invested in 
your country in any profitable business propossed by you. 

We have never met, but I want to trust you and please do not let me 
down when this fund 
finally gets into your account. Please if you are interested, get to me 
through the email 
address below to enable me feed you with more details and all necessary 
documentations. 

Please treat this as confidential.  (  mboyo1122@mail.com   or   
wilfredy2k@email.com )

Regards,

Dr.Wilfred Mboyo

NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please 
inform me so that i can look for another reliable person who can assist me.

ATTN:THE PRESIDENT/CEO
Dear Sir, 
I humbly wish to seek your assitance in a matter that is very important and also of mutual benefit. I am Alfred Kumalo, a business consultant and a close confidant to one of South African most powerful families. One of our high network clients wishes to move out of this country the sum of US$30 million. She wishes to invest the aforementioned sum in viable businesses overseas. 
For obvious reasons,my client does not wish to place this fund with established financial institution in the family's name for security reasons.It is her desire that the deal be handled as quietly as possible without possibility of any leakage to the public or South African government. 
She has therefore instructed and empowered me to look for a reliable foreigner who can arrange and receive this money in his/her acount overseas and assist to invest the fund properly for the family.If you agree to act as a fund manager to my client and her family,we shall release the said sum to you if you meet the necessary requirements.
Your commision shall be down payment of 10% of the total sum,and an annual 10% of the after tax returns on investment for the first five years.Thereafter,the terms shall be varied. If you are capable and willing to participate in this transaction,reach me through my personal email 
Best Regards, 
Alfred Kumalo.

One of the most valuable reference tools has just been released -
CensusCD 2000 Long Form.

Anyone who needs demographic, housing, economic or population 
Information about the US will want CensusCD 2000 Long Form.  It 
includes such variables as income, housing value, employment, 
education, poverty, ancestry, commute to work, etc.  For a complete
list of variables go to
http://www.uscensus.info/census2000/lf_variables.htm .  
The data is available from the Nation down to Tract, Zip code 
and the Block Group level. There are 5,500 variables available
at the Block Group level, and an additional 11,000 are available
at the Tract level and above.

This data set will be the basis for most demographic analysis for the
next ten years.  GeoLytics has made it easy to query the data so that
you can run a report for just the data you want to see for only the 
geographies you specify.  This data set is so complete that it is on
4 CD's. The cost for CensusCD 2000 Long Form is $895 for the nation 
or $449 for a single state.

If you are interested in time series analysis we recommend the 
CensusCD Neighborhood Change Data Base.  It has Tract level data from
1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000.  This product offers the data in the 
census-defined geographies as well as 1970, 1980 and 1990 normalized
to 2000 boundaries for exact comparisons of demographic changes over 
time.  Our Long Form version of this product will be out at the end 
of 2002.  The price for this product is $1195 for the Short Form 
version with a $400 upgrade to the Long Form version (it will be 
$1,595 in it's final format).

All of our census-based products come with built-in mapping 
capabilities. With a few quick keystrokes you can generate full-blown
maps or tables.  You can export the file data into other programs
such as statistical (e.g. SAS, SPSS), database (e.g. Access, Oracle),
spreadsheet (e.g. Excel, 1-2-3), and mapping (e.g. Arc View, MapInfo) 
packages.
